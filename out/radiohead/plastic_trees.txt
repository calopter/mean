Come on we've all been there right?  In our fake plastic love?  You know?  That person that you knew deep deep down would never work out, but you thought they were beautiful or special, and thereby you were being fake pretending to be something you were not with that person. Trying to make that person happy by being fake.  It wears you out.  Somehow though you keep hanging on for along time because he or she tastes and looks like the real thing....you think if this relationship ends you might blow through the ceiling; you can't help the feelings you still have for the person...but the relationship wears you out and you are living on borrowed time as you know in the long run it could never work...it's fake and plastic. Add:  In the end you know if you could be who your partner wanted it would work..but you can't, you can only be yourself in the end because gravity wins. adn - you completely changed my entire concept of what this song meant, completely nailed it thats what I'm going through, i know there was a reason i drifted to this song A++ on that write-up. I think it's about wanting something you can't have, but even that thing you desire so much isn't what you need.  "She tastes like the real thing." in a world full of fakeness, he wants desperatly to believe that this one is "the real thing."  He's willing to be fake himself.  Have you ever seen the shel silverstein poem about the woodpecker and the rubber tree? it just keeps pecking anyway. it's absolute desperation. "The saddest thing I ever did see Was a woodpecker peckin' at a plastic tree. He looks at me, and 'Friend,' says he, 'Things ain't as sweet as they used to be.'" -Shel Silverstein Close.  It's about desiring to be something more for someone else.  If I could be all you wanted.  It's the desperation of not being enough for someone whom you wish would feel that you were enough. There are 3 stories: a woman wrapped in fake happiness, a man creating fake realities and who is eventually owned by it, and the speaker's own love. For me the first two serve as a backdrop for the third story. The third story is actually where the music picks up. Simliar to what has been posted, it's about loving someone so much that you are forced to be someone you are not. The song laments on how difficult it is, but he has no choice. Love makes you do crazy stuff. It makes you endure things you don't want to endure. But it's wearing him out. How it ends is really up to you. this is the interpretation that may best reflect the intent of the composer, IMHO. It is very interesting though, to see how everyone gives it a different interpretation based on the filter of their own personal context they see it through. With that in mind, I take and own the part where he says: It wears me out. It wears me out... And it wears me out, it wears me out It wears me out, it wears me out If i could be who you wanted If i could be who you wanted all the time, all the time I played this song while I was contemplating suicide. I was (still) facing a lot of heartache: my asperger's is a significant obstacle to my social life, my dad physically and verbally abuses me, and the women i love are nice but are shallow, materialistic and don't love me back. By august 26, these things wore me out and i finally tried to kill myself because i felt like no one will ever love me enough to stop hurting me like my dad or love me for who i am. If i could be who she wanted me to be, i feel that women would finally accept me. this shallowness of our society just destroys good hearted people who may not be gorgeous but have a lot to offer. this song is easily one of my favorite songs but it is also one of the saddest songs for this reason. It is unfortunate that such great deep songs always make some people think (more) of suicide.  I think the fact that they impact someone so drastically clearly indicates the songs' brilliance despite the potentially negative side effect. I was at that point too. But believe me you will find love man. We all do. But in the mean time do what makes you happy. (Unless that's skinning people and making them into lamps) ((if you watch American horror story you know what I mean)) You seem pretty awesome actually! The way you an push through all that you've been through. You're stronger than you realize. I can't be sure if you are still alive, who knows maybe you actually did it.  I can say that when I heard this song a  couple of months after I tried for my fifth and final time to kill myself, that if I had heard this song I might of actually gone through with it. All my attempts were very bad ones,  but I just wanted to see if I could feel anything, or if there was still something inside me that made me human. I remember that when I used to cut myself that I couldn't feel anything as the blade went through, it was just numb. Later, when I tried to do it by bath, I felt numb when the blade went through the first couple of times, but I realized that I just couldn't get myself to cut deep enough. I was too afraid to push the blade any further and about what would happen if I stayed alive after such a huge cut. After I talked myself out of it, I believe that would of been my third attempt,  for the first time I could feel the pain. The pain had scared me shitless. I realized that if I was going to do it, it wouldn't be by cutting. I don't know what I was really talking about there but I don't know, just thought I  would share my experience Hey.. I hope you're okay... There's hardly anyone who hasn't gone through such things, I myself had been in love with my best friend, who rejected me. If they dont reciprocate the love, sure we do feel like it's the end of the world and we do feel very hurt and depressed but we just gotta move on and not beat ourselves over it for too long cuz if that person doesn't understand how much we feel for them, then its just not worth it to waste so much of our feelings on them. Dont let ppl and circumstances bring u down. Its not ur fault that u have Asperger's. I hope u are okay and I hope u have moved on from that rough patch There's something so piercing about this song and its utter sense of hopelessness, yet it ultimately makes it so comforting So true... I love this song, but afraid to hear it He's talking about the American lifestyle. We don't care about how something really is, as long as it looks good and gives a good impression to those whose opinions mean something to us. The girl married the guy, because her family would be happy she married a successful guy who probably did plastic surgery which is faker  than fake. Everyone is just living in a house of cards, no one knows who anyone really is anymore because society dictates what we should be. Wow, great and sad song, Thom is a genius... this song quite describes my life right now ): In a world that people and feelings are shallow and fake, I found a different and sensitive girl, a girl who sees the things as I do...and soon i was madly in love with her "She looks like the real thing She tastes like the real thing" And yeah, after a long time gathering courage, and that feeling burning me inside, i told her how much i love her, how much i care and want to stay with her... but she just don't care about me and my feelings. I don't make any difference in her life... "It wears me out"... Even thought, i still love her, but i can't do anything about it, she doesn't want me... "If I could be who you wanted all the time" shit, i want you so much. can't stop crying listening to this :'( It's incredible how close your tale is to mine. I am plagued by my infatuation with this girl, but unlike your tale, she is no different to the plastic people I see daily. She ignores me and just doesn't even want to have anything to do with me. Oh how I wish I could be who she wanted. can i join the club?? But I might win with my history. Is quite simple, this girl was everything I wanted, she was more than perfect, utterly beautiful and deeply interesting, we shared a vision you could say and the best part: she was in love with me, just like i was in love with her. We had a long realtionship like for a year, half our senior year and first semester in college. Then things started to turn bad. Then I realized that it was because she started change with college, he started to be like everybody else, kindda shallow, different plastic friends, didnt care anymore about lots of things we both thought matter a lot. Then she just stopped loving me, cause of course, i wasnt anymore what she wanted.. Damn to nrs182`s story! I know you feeling bro. I Its remind me to my brake up just 3 weeks ago. It is so close to my story. Only, i feel more lucky because i just date this girl just for 2 months. Short story, Similar as yours, she started to like everybody else. In just 2 month we are so close,, one of my most intimate relationship. But after she meeting that bastard, who is more likely to be her father, it completely different. When we broke up, she said that she never went to serious relationship with me, just a shallow one. What a fake! To me this song is all about artificial societal conformity. The goal to be what the world deems is 'perfect' is a constant challenge because of aging and 'gravity' as mentioned in the song. It speaks of a man who was a plastic surgeon who once thought looks were everything, that's where he first fell in love and that's where his money came from, but eventually he realized that there is no authenticity in pretending to be something else. The perpetual struggle to remain perfect actually causes imperfection, and in conclusion, 'it wore him out', like it wears all of us out. Perfection is nonexistent, and we're all living in a fake plastic world trying to be something we're not. My take.  This is a song about a woman who married a rich plastic surgeon and had the perfect live living in the suburbs.  Years later, neither were happy.  He was a depressed plastic surgeon and she realized the material things didn't make her happy anymore.  She was stuck in the the suburbs acting like she was happy with her fake smile, fake watering can, watering her flowers, which she didn't give a shit about,  while here she still lived with her miserable, depressed husband.  WOuld make a rather good fictional book. this is my favorite song... whenever i cant sleep, i put on this song and im out like a light.  his voice is just so soothing, ya know?  i think this song is about how everything in the world is so corrupt and... fake?  even the trees... and its like not even love can be real anymore.. Oh, man.  I was on my way to bed when this song came on, and now I can't help but think this is going to be a long and sleepless night. This song is actually for the mass marketing and mass consumption. It has nothing to do with fake love. Thom yorke isn't that shallow to tell everybody that love is fake. Read Radiohead From A Great Height and you will understand why I say this is what it is about. All of Radiohead's videos are.. excellent. And Thom's voice is superb. This is one of my favorite songs by them, either this or Knives Out (with another amazing video). When I saw them live, Tom said this song was about the London Docklands Development in London. The docklands was regenrated into a false environment that meant the original residents of the area moved away and "yuppies" moved in. The environment is totally false and put on there, and is a metaphor for how the world is becoming. It has notrhing to do with love as such. Just because Thom saw it as that doesnt mean that other people can interpret it as being about love. That is what is great about Radiohead you can look at it from so many different angles. Personally I got that he sees this person and she is everything that society would expect her to be, perfect in everyway. He is saying that it is not possible, she has to have her own personality, her own identity- not just societal values. The way I see it, is the singer is watching the new life of a woman he once loved. She was fake, as in she preteneded to be someone she wasn't. The singer wasn't like that, and she left him for a guy who was fake and who makes others fake. The last part of the song is his frustration that she threw herself into this fake world, even though he knows she would be better off if she was real. In the last line, he is wishing that he could be what she wanted all of the time, so she would be with him, but he refuses to because he doesn't want to be fake like everyone else. I still remember a dream I had when I was about 13, about a girl... It was just a scene of her, we didnt even speak, just a look she gave me from a distance, of hope, as if saying I'm fine, but please, i need your help... She looks like the real thing, my fake plastic love. I woke up and never seen her again, but naive as I am, I still love her at 16. Ok, interpret it how you like. It doesn't mean it's the right way does it? marijuana + fake plastic trees = WOW!!!! According to Thom, this song is about Canary Warf in London. A song written for the world of mass marketing and mass consumption. This expresses one aspect of how fake the world has become. I love the lyrics and it's fun to sing along with. Beautiful song. Was anyone as surprised as me to see how the video to this song looked like? Ok I expected to be fucked up as Radiohead are such geniuses that we can conprehend what they on about. I just pictured something more dark maybe moodier, like Street Spirits video. Oh well, its still good. This is my personally my fave Radiohead song. Make me cry everytime and I don't who you are, male or female - you just will. Makes me think of life in a different way, the song can really stir up such emotions. Anyone feel the same? Truly something moving. Radiohead have created a masterpiece in 'Fake Plastic Trees', and as to what the song is about.... dunno - I'm dumb. What has made me laugh is that I work behind a till and a supermarket and just they other day I took a green plastic watering can through my checkout - had to laugh. Oh well hehehehe. this girl has no sense of right or wrong. completely faithless, hence her living with the 'broken man'.. 'fake plastic love' = faking the emotions. everything nowadays is fake, yadda yadda yadda. and the beat goes on. Being one of the best songs out there, there are so many ways to interpret it. I interpreted it as everything being so fake, but he finds this girl within it all who he sees as so real. She is different: "She looks like the real thing, she tastes like the real thing." But the irony is that she does not want him, and this wears him out. He will never find anyone. "I wish i could be who you wanted, all the time." this song is great. all of the interpretations are right, it is what you want it to be. it's weird, i'm currently pretty down on life, but there is this one girl, she is so perfect in my eyes...but i know, i really know that no one is, but i don't want to believe it, because i'm looking for something to live for. and when i'm around her, i try to act different than who i really am to please her, or to please the popular idea of what attractive is, and i know it's wrong...but i just can't help it. something so unnatural has become the "natural" thing to do. it's sad really. i wish i could just talk to her, just tell her all of this stuff, just get real deep into the core of her, so she could understand why i am who i am. but she's probably to affected by the superficial world to have any desire to do so. i have dreams in which the world is ending somehow, but i don't care, because i'm with her, we're just staring into eachothers eyes. i'm as happy as i've ever been just being with her, even though death is certain. i could go on and on. "I will say that I heard from a reliable source that when the record company realized what a powerful song this is they presented a remixed version to the band that eliminated a lot of the technological and musical goodies from the album version so as to emphasize Thom's vocals. The band rejected that, and instead Thom went into the studio to record an accoustic version. By the end of the second take, Thom was crying so hard he could sing no more. So if you have heard the accoustic version, now you know a little more about what went into making it. " That is great. It makes me feel so good to know that he puts so much emotion into his music, that it makes even himself cry. If this song was just the last line "if i could be who you wanted all the time" it would still be my favorite song ever. i used to be her... get out while you still can... it really does wear you out.  fall in love -- don't look for it and try to make it happen. that's all i have to say One of the saddest, most beautiful songs ever written.  I think it's about the challenge of living in a superficial world, even if you're not a superficial person.  The girl you love for everything she is as a person (and not for superficial reasons) may indeed turn you down for someone more attractive. It's heart-ache to the nth degree, it really is. Mostly because you know she can't be happy forever with the deluded choice she's made, but you can't tell her that just the same... sigh... okay, sorry i'm ranting now. this is about a blow-up doll obviously, kinda sick and twisted, but i LIKE it.... lol.blow up doll..?maybe.. cool song no doubt Isn't the last line piercing though? - "If I could be who you wanted/If I could be who you wanted all the time." It's desperation definately. Throwing your hands up in frustration and exhaustion and just letting go - screaming to the top of your lungs at the anger of what you can't be/what she can't be. Great song. well i hope the line isnt too "piercing" cause then he'd pop his blowup doll... um... ha ha? No... wait... was I supposed to laugh? Don't think I'm dismissing your idea... it's a good idea. I almost agree with you, but I think that it's about a lot more than a blowup doll. It has more of a deeper meaning than just the words on the surface. And please... no more jokes. It's just going to discredit your idea even more. I don't have any comments that haven't already been raised. I'd just like to say that this is a lovely song. the last line in this song is the most significant to me.. if i could be who you wanted... if i could be who you wanted.. all the time... wow. great song. this is my favorite song ever written this song is so utterly sad and displays comeplete hopelessness, and its just so good and meaningful with saying such few words i can't get enough of it. the lyrics especially show the energy it takes to fulfill someone elses or your own expectations, especially shown in the last line. such a great song and a great voice too. My favorite Radiohead song, always has been always will be. I've seen Radiohead in concert a number of times but they won't do this song. I think this song can be incorporated in to everyones life and some low point they have faced. This song is about the painful discovery and acceptance of an illusion. A woman realizes her whole universe isn't real, and she's hopeless. The man she lives with realizes the illusions he created aren't real, and the man's hopeless. -- He loves her, but she doesn't love him back, and he realizes he never really loved her (because he can't be who she wants him to be), and he's hopeless.  The truth is they're all hopeless. This song is confusing because his love is real. That's why he "can't help the feeling." But it doesn't matter to him, because he thinks if his love is real, then she would love him back. He thinks if he really loved her, he could be who she wants him to be, and he can't. -- It's a deeply faceted, beautiful, sad song. Actually I lied. I think it means that he doesn't love her. He's realized he doesn't love her. That's why his love is fake plastic. He could "blow through the ceiling" running away from her. He wishes he could love her, because she loves him. He wishes he could be who she wants him to be, but he doesn't love her. I am listening to it right now on a dreary minnesota fall day, today it is calming to me, and other times i have driven around in my car with it on repeat just SOBBING...There isn't any particular thing about it that is so sad, just the combination of the words with the vocals and the guitar that grows... Who hasn't felt that way....we are so thirsty for love we are willing to try what we know is fake, but we can't fool our hearts... What an amazing song (This might not make much sense, it was more well thought out in my head) I think this song is about ENVY & REGRET... There is always someone, real or not, who is what you want to be. How things could be different if you more like that person. You make up stories and ideas that flow with the attraction of your envy. The feelings you and your lover will feel. They feel real, and it hurts to know that they are in your head. It won't happen. Never. HENCE; " She Looks like the real thing. She tastes like the real thing, my fake plastic love. " You want to become like the person, you feel the feelings your envy will feel.. HENCE;"...she bought from a rubber man in a town full of rubber plans to get rid of itself,- it wears her out. " No matter what you to to yourself, you cant become different. HENCE; "He used to do surgery for girls in the eighties but GRAVITY always wins and it wears him out." You feel as if you more like this, you're lover will return the feelings you feel about them... HENCE; "But I Can't Help The Feeling. I Could Blow Through The Ceiling. " & " If i could be who you wanted all the time.. " I agree with everyone's ideas about this song... it makes me cry everytime i hear it. What i think of it: It's an extremely sad and true song cause it talks about how people go through life being something they are not, just to satisfy other people and how hard it is to go through ur entire life like this! If i could be who you wanted all the time.. Hey all, nothing new to say, I'm just one more person who life was touched by this song. Dammit people! It's just another break-up song. The vocals were indeed recorded in two takes after Thom had attended a Jeff Buckley set, and he did indeed break down in tears. I belive its about a girl who's had a lot of plasic surgery, and obveriously ended up woith the surgen, its now the 90's and she no's she isn't what she really is, she is not herself, she wants to be herself again 'She Looks like the real thing. She tastes like the real thing, my fake plastic love.' this seems to me like she her self is plastic, fake. this to me is a girl who has lots of plastic surgery during the 80's and is now regretting it, she has married her doctor, and no 1 uis ever perfect to him, she wants to be herself, she feels she is fake, its very sad song, i love it. i absolutely love this song. It has this something about it that makes you feel like maybe its about you. And how you cant live your life being something that your not. It just doesnt work like that. Its just too hard and it hurts too much. i dont know if this is right or wrong,  in th lyrics using 2 negatives : fake, plastic.. makes it real.. dont u think? the fake plastic, implies that the plastic the tree is made out of is fake.. therefore its real.. well i dont know but there might be a postive side to this song as well i think if thom yorke had his way he would of wished fake plastic would take creep spot ... but this song shows a true radiohead fan yeh creep is clever and well written but fake plastic is the artist showing raw emotions and feelings you can almost feel his voice crying out please stop the superficial world but then he realizes at the end the mass will always rule and hes apologetic nature for if he could be who everyone wanted but he cant ... thank you thom yorke for making the honest music that you make "the fake plastic, implies that the plastic the tree is made out of is fake.. therefore its real.." no i dont think so. singing trees that are fake and made of plastic isnt as smooth as just saying fake, plastic trees. you can't sing a comma, so the song is how it is. This song is trying to change something in all of us. we are so focussed on our outside and we are completely forgot what's on the inside. Inner beauty is still very important. don't forget that. this song sends chills up my spine.  i dont know what this is about, but i'm at boarding school and this is what i put on in my room when i feel like i'm in a pressure cooker.  i love it here, but sometimes i feel like im in a school to breed trophy wives and stupid doctors and i hate finding myself acting like a clone of the people i am surrounded by, shortchanging who i am. but then when i try to be myself, i get so worn down, feeling like i always have to be something spectacular in order to justify my difference.  this song is like coming home, letting it wash over me and its like being recharged. when it says If I could be who you wanted all the time...I feel like its me talking to myself, telling myself to chill out and not forcing myself to be any cookie cutter of anything. I dont have to be a rebel, but i dont have to be all pink and polka dots all the time (though sometimes its fun!) PS, that was such a vent.  Its amazing what putting that into words can do. pretty self explanatory. what's left to define? One of my very favorite Radiohead songs.  Say what you want about its meaning, it's a powerful and raw song and it's unforgettable I agree with most of the comments made, but something just gave me the urge to express what i think a certain verse means; ".....used to do surgery for girls in the eighties, but gravity always wins". Now you may call me a perv, but when i hear that i get the impression that he is talking about breats implants, and the man did the surgery. The lyric "gravity always wins" means no matter if you get a breast implant, gravity always pulls them down, i.e. they're still going to be saggy in the end. So sweet and so much sad too.. I just love it... Okay - someone needs to correct the typos on those song lyrics, badly. I read this on greenplastic.com and found it interesting: According to Thom, this song is about Canary Warf in London. This song is one of the band's largest hits - always played live. A song written for the world of mass marketing and mass consumption. Many versions of "Fake Plastic Trees" are available, including the single from The Bends and an acoustic version on the CD single part 2, which also appears on the Clueless soundtrack. This song was the band's proudest moment, and it remains a live favorite for obvious reasons. o man. this song is so amazing. many of you are not giving it the credit it deserves. I think the Bends album is overlooked far to much. So very true. Just how does these means of expression do justice for the mastermind behind the lyrics?? Definitley the best lyrical, meaningful song by Radiohead. He is wanting to love the girl and wanting to see through her materialistic self, but "gravity always wins" and his attempts to do so "wears him out". He tries to convince himself that she is infact from the heart and real "she looks like the real thing, she tastes like the real thing" but he simply cant comprehend his deeper feelings of angst for her. In the end he tells her that they are simply too incompatible "if i could be who you wanted". He "turns and runs" in order to give himself relief. And in the end, there is no point in trying to love someone who you know is not right, whether they be "fake" or "plastic" in putting up a facade for the world, you know that love is not really there, and that by kidding yourself that there is love, is just futile and can only end in tears. How truely moving. i dont have anything to say that hasn't already been said about the song's meanings..but i love this song, it's one of those songs you could just listen to over and over and over and never get tired of it....it's sad and kind of hopeless, but so beautiful the song is about fake boobs: He used to do surgery for girls in the eighties but GRAVITY always wins and it wears him out. She Looks like the real thing. She tastes like the real thing, my fake plastic love. I think it talks about how candycoated life is, its boring and pointless, but we all entertain ourselves with our television and video games; when really the world as we know it steadily dropping in values. These days everything is fake. This song is the greatest song of all time! THOM IS A GENIOUS! but in my opinion i think this song is a song about a guy or anyone for that matter whos in love with a girl and cant handle to see him with someone else and his love is just to strong to handle and everyone just not being able to handle life because its so fake I read that this song is about the reincarnation. but is not that. Is about how the goverment makes us so fake . Goverment=trees. so they SUPPLY -FAKE- and we DEMAND it. The people just don`t have a clue of what`s is going on, and a lot of "Fake Stuff" is in "today`s music"  like the shit that is in MTV. The Fake shit is the -feeling that some people can`t help it- it`s like be HAPPY but just for a moment and then you fucking realize that all that HAPPY MOMENT WAS FUCKING FAKE and by the way SHE is not literally a woman is -fake feeling- This song is absolutley brilliant. If I could write like thom yorke I'd be............................................... Absolutley brilliant, LOL. To me, this song is reaching that realization when you are with the person you love, and you figuire out that although you think you are the one for the person, in your heart, you know this person well enough that you aren't that special someone to them. And, as much as that realization sucks, you have to move on...otherwise you are wasting precious time...for you and that someone. Wow I never realised this song could be analysed in so many different ways. One of my favourite radiohead songs, it is sad yet so beautiful. It literally took my breath away the first time I heard it. This song is so depressing but I can't stop listening to it I think Keelyt is pretty bang on in a way...  the way I see it is a man talking about his partner - who is superficially perfect.  He feels that he isn't good enough for her, and just gets more and more depressed - 'broken', 'cracked' and 'crumbles and burns' pretty much sum this up. In the end he realises that he doesn't want someone like that (i.e. looks etc aren't everything) and decides that he could be so much bigger and better if he left her - 'I could blow through the ceiling If I just turn and run'...however I get the feeling that it would never happen and he's just dreaming. A great song, one i'd never really thought about all that much until today. This song hits home and makes me cry because my relationship is like this. :( I apologize as I haven't read all of the posts for Fake Plastic Trees before posting, so if I sound like an already broken record, I apologize. I really enjoy this song despite its dreary message:  Life is full of falsities.  Things like fake plants look pretty at first glance, but their missing the other beautiful characteristics of a flower (aromatic, soft to the touch, feed the earth oxygen, etc).  Faces and bodies altered to look more like how society measures beauty are pleasing to the eye, but upon further examination, the people masked by these aesthetically pleasing faces and bodies are ugly and fragile.  And in all cases, relationships predicated on the physical rather than emotional, spiritual or something deeper than outward appearances, are as fake and fragile. The last line fits this song so perfectly: "If I could be who you wanted all the time."  In the pursuit of meaning in the world, too often people focus on what others what them to be rather than who they already are.  Nobody is satisfied with who they are, and in turn, they're never satisfied with who anybody else is either. I think what Yorke is conveying is his own frustration in the masks people wear (and that he himself likely wears) to please others.  "It wears him out..."  "It wears me out...." and so on.  Being something that someone else wants you to be is draining mentally AND physically, and is not worth it.  Yorke's frustration over this is beautifully conveyed with those four words "It wears her/him/me out..."  But I don't see the entire song as an anthem for the disgruntled outcasts of society.  I think by singing about the recognization of the falseness in this world, Yorke actually conveys a message of understanding that people will be one way, and if he's not that way (or we're not that way), that life will be okay.  It'll drag on a person, either one faking their way through life or cast aside for being who they are, but understanding goes both ways. Just my two cents. i still cant believe Thom did this beautiful song in one take, and without the other instruments. I think its preety clear that the song is about a woman whos wastign her life away pretending to be someone she's not. Amazing sogn tho prolly my fav on the bends It's a good song, quite depressing though. I find a lot of Radiohead is depressing to the point where I really would rather not listen to it. I know this interpretation has been touched upon a couple of times, and i'm surprised few people have considered it but the second verse is definately about breast implants. "gravity always wins" is obviously the struggle for perfection that is ultimately fruitless as boobs will sag. whenever i hear "cracked polystyrene man" i think of someone wearing casts. Maybe an accident. It does remind me a hell of a lot of the film 'Breast Men' But in the end it's all a tad pedantic. The meaning of the song is pretty clear. Struggling to feel adequete in a fake world. on the live at the astoria dvd he says its about canary wharf Immortality this is my favorite radiohead song :] This song is really about our modern society. The main character sees that this girl lives a terribly phony life with a ridiculously fake guy who has no clue of how bad his situation is. At one time she tried to get ahead by starting off down this path, but now desperately tries shock herself back to life. The main character can't help but love this girl even though he knows what's going on, and he's willing to sacrifice his humanity and become totally fake for her. Its really about what sorts of terrible things love(people's strongest and most alive emotion) can do to you. In this situation, love is "killing" the main character, and has already "killed" the woman he desires. What this song means is that we can either be real and not be excepted by society, or we can be fake but atleast then we will be excepted, and although its easy to say its better to be real, we all want to be excepted. sorry if i spelt any words wrong From Wikipedia: "Fake Plastic Trees" is a song by Radiohead, from their second album The Bends. It was also the third single to be released from that album. A song written for the world of mass marketing and mass consumption. The band had just been to see Jeff Buckley play a set, and when they got back into the studio, Thom Yorke recorded the vocals in two takes and broke down in tears after that. In fact, the vocals heard on the song were originally meant to be a guide vocal, meaning that they would eventually be re-done after the rest of the band recorded their instruments. However, Thom's performance was flawless, so they kept it. This song is one of the band's finest of their early catalogue and is considered one of their largest hits among Creep. The song rarely miss the live spot of their set-lists, as the band are considered great live band. According to Thom this song is about Canary Wharf in London. How about we all read some Douglas Adams?  Specifically, "Life, the Universe, and Everything". This song seems to be about how people are so cheap and insincere. Maybe it's just me but doesn't everyone feel this way at some time? I mean, even if not often or not long don't we all, at some point, feel like everything is just fake, ourselves included? Yeah, sure, we live in a materialistic society in a materialistic age. Even without all that, though, I, for one, still feel, at times, like it's all somehow unreal, a show we all put on and, somehow, manage to unite in. this song has really impacted me, since the first time i heard it... it's just amazing, i love radiohead. anyway, what i've seen looking into in this song is pretty much along the lines of what most of you have had to say... and i don't know if anyone has also mentioned something like this, but for me it reminds me of the futuristic books i have read in the past (Anthem, Fahrenheight 451, The Giver) ... and this is the society that we ourselves have created,  and its like the outcome of a previous "utopian-like" one that had came previously, where everyone is in a state of misery, numb and burnt out from creating such idealistic lifestyles and expectations, and they have all forgotten what is real because they are no longer real. they are all like robots in a sense. so i see this guy looking in on a world from the outside, at this girl he loves who has fallen into the pragmatic traps of the society, and he wishes he could save her, but he also feels that it's too late, because she too shares the extreme expectations of everyone else in her world and he could never be up to par with that... and so he just falls into a state of hopelessness and despair. This song always reminds me of a doll, all look, even touch, but then again your always reminded that it's fake, and nature is doomed never to make somnething so perfect. I saw radiohead play in chicago on august 1, 2001 at hutchison field.  this song was the finale.  i was 19 at the time.  my college girlfriend was visiting me from the east coast.  i completely fell in love with her when i heard this song.  i think this song has so much love in it, it might just be a little too much.  maybe that's why it makes you sad.  it's just bursting with love. First of all this song is very beautiful, for the music alone, but mainly for Thom's voice. I think it's about a girl who he loves but either she doesn't return the feelings or they both know "they" could never be, for whatever reason.  So the ideology that he has for his "fake plastic love" is still inside him and he loves her so he says "If i could be who you wanted..." because he wants so badly for these fake trees and plants and earth to be real. why do all of you seem to think you are so different than everyone. we are all the same, trying to answer the same questions, trying to be happy, and until we figure that out, nothing can be changed. this song is great i was introduced to this song by an exboyfriend who was struggling to admit to himself and i, that he was an alcoholic. i had more of an understanding when he underlined the last verse. but for me the last line if i could be who you wanted all the time was the most powerfull line and the way thom sings is it so haunting. makes my heart ache everytime i here it, conjures up so many emotions i've had in my life yet not one of my favourite tracks off all time as it reminds me of so much heartache more than anything else. reminds me of a trophey wife, that loves her man but theyre all just fake and plastic. shes struggling i still cannot believe Thom Yorke did this song in one take.  I think this song is about two things...one how fake our world can be, and two someone's love for a person whom they cant have, but want so they use something fake, not the real thing...I.E. She looks like the real thing, She Tastes like the real thing. well, Thom always introduces the song saying it's about Canary Wharf...but how? Its about how people change for "following their heart" and that now all the people is lead by their sensibility and not by their intellgence. And thats how some persons persuade you to do things or change in what you belive. They just tell you "follow your heart" or "follow your fealings" Death to Romance- Life to the Love (that almost doesnt exist) "She Looks like the real thing. She tastes like the real thing, my fake plastic love. But I Can't Help The Feeling. I Could Blow Through The Ceiling. If I Just Turn And RUN." the part I love the most, this song is amazing, great vocals, and touching lyrics We can never really be completely honest about ourselves. There are the extremes like people going under the knife to satisfy what they think society demands of them. Still, there are other, more subtle ways in which we all, every one of us, hide and pretend. It's exhausting and depressing for all of us, in our own ways. To me this song represents the futility of it all. We all seek out some sort of ideal for ourselves and society but we all have to compromise. It does wear me out. I envy those for whom it seems to come so easily. Then again I'm not so naive as to believe that it is any less exhausting to be the status quo as it is to fight against it. This is, quite possibly, my all time favourite song. This song is what made me really fall in love (and I mean love) with Radiohead. Fakes fakes fakes. They're all around us. The truth really does come out in this song. Everyone and everything is fake. NOTHING is real. No one's happy just being themselves. They just want to please everyone. The gravity line is tad bit for comic relief. As soon as the, "My fake plastic love" comes up, I cry. (Just like Thom Yorke did when he finished singing this song for the first time) But I can't help the feeling I could blow through the ceiling... Wow. It's powerful. And of course the last line. I've never heard anything like this song. Ever. Yorke is pure brilliance. I believe the melody is just as simple as the song, easy, yet amazing. V1.The woman longs for a change in the way she looks at the world. She tries so hard to make a difference it wears her out. V2.Her husband didn't want to change the world, just the people that live in it, he didn't have the same views as her. He changed the people on the outside, but through time the truth came through, and in the end we all look the same. V3.The foridden fruite is assembled, and you can only see what you will never be, can feel what you can never taste. V4.After excepting the facts, to know that you can never change, he conformed to society, and decided to be himself. V5.And yourself is exactly what she wants, to be unitedd with society, is to be suseptible to individuality and in the end, become unique, but lost without hope. This is all my opinion, you don't have to agree with me. R.P.Green It's true that the song was originated at the idea of a man in love with his blow-up doll, as Yorke has accepted, but he also says that although the song was originated at a joke, when he'd finished writing the song, it was no more a joke. haha after reading all of these I feel really shallow. To me the song is by far one of my favorites. But I always thought it was pretty self expanatory, what I got out of it, He's having an affair with a woman in Los Angeles, ( a town full of rubber plans to get rid of itself).  She's not satisfied at all with the way she looks so she has plastic surgery, surgically enhanced. I guess a big part of what made me think this way, is because "she lives with a broken man" perhaps her older husband who "used to do surgery for girls in the 80's" but "gravity always wins", I cant figure out any other way that to interpret some of these lyrics.  Under her pretty posterior, she's very very sad, in her situation. The end could be contributed  to how it's not real, he knows it, but it feels like it .  Just a real desperate song all together. A watering can for a fake plant to make it grow into a full tree, and the trees are some of our interpersonal relationships. I'm sorry if anyone already has said this, but I didn't feel like reading through all that text. I agree with those people stating that this song is referring to an unrequited love, and I agree with the blow-up doll theory. But I'm more concerned with the music video. I believe in my interpretation of the lyrics because of the way Thom is depicted in the music video. He is portrayed as a little boy in a shopping cart that can't get what he wants (we've all seen this scenario in our trips to the grocery) --  what he wants being the girl he has been pursuing. We are allowed to be fake I guess, if we become that way to make someone else feel real. He seems to have been the victim of the situation. Someone may have been fake for him, and he feels fucked over because of it. So he knows what he believes in is fake, he just needs some kind of evidence that love is a thing that hasn't become that way too. I like reidbottorffs interp. Awesome song. Pretty depressing though. The line that always stood out to me was "My fake plastic love". I always thought that was the core of the song. My interpretation was that he's in a relationship and he so desperately wants to be in love with her. So much so that he's trapped. And all this effort he's putting in and not getting anything back is wearing him out. I was thinking everything else he mentions in the song as being fake was merely to emphasize how fake it is. I doubt this is the original intented meaning after doing my research (Canary Wharf) and reading others opinions, more a comment on modern life (I think winkyone said it best "I, for one, still feel, at times, like it's all somehow unreal, a show we all put on and, somehow, manage to unite in") But as  Mwalte2 said the song is just bursting with love. to me, this song is about the depression that comes during those existential crises that everyone has on occasion, often after a painful breakup. you doubt the meaning of all that you do, and all that you have done. you doubt the necessities of all the orders and structures in the world. and probably worst of all, you doubt if you even know what real love is. thom conveys this desperate pain in the way he sings "she looks like the real thing, she tastes like the real thing, my fake plastic love." he so desperately wanted his (ex) girlfriend to be his true love, but their love disappeared, and he is left wondering if any of it was real. also, the verse about the man who does plastic surgery is about how the attempt to maintain beauty and youth and essentially "defy" what is inevitable--aging, etc.--always fails, thanks to reality or "gravity". this messages segues very poignantly into the following verse--as if a drooping face trying to deny its oldness, the love he had fell apart, succumbed to "gravity." that's what i get from this song. I think it's about the difficulty of trying to always keep up an image.  An "image" is by definition a reproduction, imitation or visual representation of something...a likeness, but not a reality.  People, especially celebrities have to keep up an image and it eventually becomes too difficult to do and "wears them out".  The fake plastic tree, boobs even the person you merry for "love" is unreal and part of the image...an image that can't last.  Towards the end there, he says he feels like he could blow through the ceiling because he's singing about a life that is no more then a stage set....paper with no substance.  The real problem is the image owns the image maker in time and the people he's fooled all his life with the image want him to remain the image....not the reality.  At the end, he's wishing he could be who the people want all the time, but it wears him out trying. I don't get this video. It's a great song nonetheless. Thom's voice is superb here. i did a project on this song...its actually about how thom or one of the band members falls in love with a beautiful girl but then realises that the reson that she is beautiful is because she is covered in plastic surgery, therefore hes really sad eventhough he knows shes completely fake he still loves her though which makes him mad SO GOOD! it's saying she is always tired because she is always trying to impress society. especially men. to feel useful. in the end it just makes her tired. like she hasn't had a second to be herself. SO GOOD! it's saying she is always tired because she is always trying to impress society. especially men. to feel useful. in the end it just makes her tired. like she hasn't had a second to be herself. I didn't know Radiohead did covers of Alanis Morissette songs, that's weird! "Fake Plastic Trees" was actually written and recorded first by Radiohead. What you hear by Alanis Morissette is merely a cover. But I've heard some of her live versions on youtube and it's still pretty good. :) you buy what you want to be the video seems to me like everything in society is commericalized, even people, and objects and people soon seem to become identical and barely differing because in the end it doesn't matter. its about a blow up doll, and this guy who's wanting her to be real. "She Looks like the real thing. She tastes like the real thing, my fake plastic love. " It's kinda the same thing. but usually i think it's about someone having a crush on somebody,but for sure, that somebody isn't there "true love" uhh, I don't think so... I agree with you because it appears to be the obvious and literal interpretation, hahaha. maybe Thom Yorke didn''t want to risk getting AIDS or HIV and has to release his sexual tension with a blow up doll cause hookers have herpes...lol yeah, its not quite as hopeless as "street spirit" but it sure is sad as hell. i love it to death though. i get that feeling sometimes where you just look at everyone and you think, god what a pathetic planet. and in a sense thats where this comes from, and goes to. i dunno. great song. So many great posts on this song....I just gotta share one of the moments when this song reached out and grabbed my soul and wouldn't let go. I was housesitting for two dear friends of mine(mid-20's); I had watched them grow up together (they began dating in eighth grade), go through high school and college, acquire good-paying corporate jobs, and settle into a pretty much upper-class suburban lifestyle.  Through it all they remained the same great kids I knew when they were 12, and I still love them dearly.  So now they're off on vacation, the house is fine, the pets are asleep, it's after midnight, and I crank up some of my mixed cd's.  On comes FAKE PLASTIC TREES. The song ends.  I have to push repeat (how could I not?), and by the end of the second playing I'm crying uncontrollably!  As I play the song over and over I look around to see a house full of green plants of all sorts in any direction I look -- not a one of them real.  Beautiful candles adorn every room -- not a one of which had ever been lit.  Paintings of roosters perch on every wall, which match the dishes, which match the coffee cups, which match the napkins, which match the fake metal rooster on the kitchen bar.......for no other reason than she was told by a "Southern Living" magazine that this was a tasteful way to decorate a home in order to proclaim:  "We've made it!  We're successful.  We're doing all the things 'successful society' suggested we do to proclaim our success." I cried for them; I cried for all the people who have bought into a fake plastic life of any sort in a quest for success;  I cried for the world in general;  I cried because the song demanded I cry.  When I was finished crying I felt good - healed in some way.  There's no way I could put into words all that the music spoke to my soul.  This story is the best way I can share my understanding of this song with you. I will say that I heard from a reliable source that when the record company realized what a powerful song this is they presented a remixed version to the band that eliminated a lot of the technological and musical goodies from the album version so as to emphasize Thom's vocals.  The band rejected that, and instead Thom went into the studio to record an accoustic version.  By the end of the second take, Thom was crying so hard he could sing no more.  So if you have heard the accoustic version, now you know a little more about what went into making it. So if this song makes you cry, I think that that's a good sign - your soul is still tuned to universal truths.  And if this song doesn't touch your soul, perhaps you need to tear down some walls, because the Eyes of Truth are always watching you. bo I think when a man and a woman grow up they have certain expectations of what their spouse/mate should be like.  And yes to win over the girl of your dreams you modify certain areas of your darker layers so that she believes that you are more like her ideal mate.  You know she's doing this too because in the beginning of any passionate love affair, you both are willing to put up with more crap just to keep the wonder new passion alive. Ah, there is the problem.  Once you are both comfortable in the relationship, you start to be who you want to be and this makes your previous courtship persona to be "fake".  You were being somewhat fake to "look like the real thing", but she was being "fake", too. He just seems doomed to lose anyone he shares his heart with because he can't live a life with any sort of sanity without being free to be himself.  But he can wish for it, "If I could be who you wanted, all the time."  To keep her love, he wishes he could change what his spouse now finds so unacceptable that she wants to abandon him. Am I divorced, yes.  Does the song resonate with me, yes. It came out in 1994 and has been my theme song with the two loves in my life.  They overlooked my imperfections in the beginning and did my damnedest to hide my clinical depression.  But just like in the song, being fake "wears me out". This song is so true for alot of guys.  we love a girl we cant have even though they are not real, they are our "fake plastics loves" The first verse is pretty self explanatory, a woman is so accustomed to her fake world that she's oblivious to how consuming it is. "a town full of rubber plans to get rid of itself" -  even the methods to avoid our "plasticity" are plastic themselves, this is major problem with post-modern society -  we realize what we are, but it changes little. "it wears her out" The second verse, which nobody is picking up on,is talking about her presumed husband, who's a plastic surgeon, a "cracked polystyrene man," who does surgery for girls in the eighties. whether or not these "girls" are in their eighties, trying to look young again, or if most of his work was done in the eighties, as a great deal of plastic surgery was done, is not entirely important. "but gravity always wins" is a double entendre, both referring to the fakeness of these surgeries, in how plastic surgery cant fight gravity; but also in the efforts he makes to fight the inevitable. "It wears him out" The ending here refers back to this idea of post-modernity, hes in love with this idea, this woman (whether the woman used is a metaphor for post-modernity, or a real woman is ambiguous, but unimportant ultimately) shes his fake "plastic love," and it turns him mad knowing what she is, but that he cant help it. now the last line. "If I could be who you wanted all the time" is an example of paraprosdokia, it really throws you for a loop. What he's saying is he wish he didn't realize how fake everything his, if he didn't keep second guessing, if he could just commit blindly, just like the rest of the world does. I believe that this song gives a good depiction of what our world is like today. I think he loves this woman, or if not loves her, really cares for her, and he wants anything for her to love him back. But she's fake; she's created a world of plastic and material things, and he's real. Being real makes him unable to get her attention or satisfy her needs. She lives with a man that is just like her in wanting things to be fake and unnatural, and even though they can relate in this sense, I think they realize that living life that way is hopeless and desperate and pathetic. He wears himself out trying to make people into what they want to be because, in the end, gravity wins. Reality wins. Our natural state wins. She's a human being, not a doll, but she wants to be a doll. She looks like the real thing, and even tastes like a woman. But she's attracted to the epitomy of everything she's not, making her fake, and making him subject to being a hopeless romantic. Beautiful song, powerful message. It's one man's warped fatalistic view of himself...and it infects relationships and any chance for decent relationships. I don't believe in fake people. I believe some people try desperately to hide who they are (be it gay or illiterate, for example) because they don't like who they are and they fear rejection. Trying to conceal one's self for fear of hurt/shame does not make anyone fake. It makes them human...and scared. I think we've all been there. Some of us just stick around in that phase a little longer than others. I think this song is about the plastic surgery culture which seems to be exploding lately. This is made obvious by the bit about the polystyrene man doing surgery, but gravity (i.e. physical age) will take over him and the prospect frightens him. The 'fake plastic love' looks and tastes 'like the real thing', I think this means that she looks and feels like a woman but she isn't, she's fake, silicone fodder. The song's speaker could 'blow through the ceiling', he's frustrated with this new trend and wants to escape. Anyone who goes along with the 'blow up doll' theory is demented, how does that explain the polystyrene man or the watering can? As for the video, in it, the characters who are not band members are quite fake-looking, suggesting that this superficialness is everywhere, also reflected in the first verse, which speaks of 'fake plastic earth'. Anyway, great song. Thom's voice is just lovely in it. my favourite radiohead song, its just about how so many dreams rely on people not being who they are, and it wears them out I agree about the lingering disappointments and consumer world we all live in. This isn't one of my favorite Radiohead tunes, but good nonetheless. And if it wasn't already mentioned, this song plays in the movie "Clueless". it means that we're all sort of dissatisfied with life and time, how it changes, and how people try to get ahead of that change, or keep things the same to stay on top. how it's useless to try to use technology to conquer this yearning we all have, because all it does is delay things, and make us fake. he tries to love this girl, but he knows his love is so twisted and its not real, that she's fake, and he's just as bad for giving in to her. beautiful song tho, hope we can all figure out what it means to truly be real. (look up the velveteen rabbit story) thanks. keep listening to radiohead everybody. i always thought it was about that certain toy ;) the best bit is when the song eplodes into "she looks like the reeeeaalll thing" it reminds me of Karma Police's "for a minute there, I lost myself" radiohead are incredible i love this song. It feels so hopeless, somewhat like Creep. This song captures beauty, yet juxtaposes it by describing a world full of corruption and social standards that inflict fake beauty to be sold. anyone ever notice this has the same melody from sleeping pills by suede? This is the closest I have evcer come to crying at a song. I agree with everyone, though I don't really think it has one particular meaning. Powerful song. This song is very touching ( as i'm listening to it now ) it just makes me realize why I begin to think too strongly of people, then realize they are something they are not.. The girl has no identity, which is the way I seem to look at alot of people these days.. If this song doesn't touch you in some way, then I suggest you get your head out of your ass.. The song is about a blow-up doll and how it actually feels real good to hump. if I could be a blow-up doll all the time "wail".. this song is about 2 ppl living together and not really loving each other 4 a long time. but they'd just keep on pretending that its all fine and they have a great love. they reflect a plastic happy family. she watters the plants like a good classic happy woman, and he has a good job as a surgerer, all so perfect but they arent really happy. they know they'd be happier if they leave, but they dont, probably because of they duties as a family, and it wears them out. this song, is sadly about abortion. listen to it, and read the lyrics, its about abortion. This song to me is about this girl who hes so inlove with but she wants more from him, wich is something he can't give her. Hes, a 'broken' man and can't give her 'real' love when shes so great and real herself. It's about being in a relationship...the Part where it's like. "if I could be who you wanted, all the time...all the time" but he can't and it wears him out trying to satisfy everyone. It's a really powerful song and you can make it whatever you really want it to be about. Wonderful song, i was going to do a massive interpretation on the song but it can mean so much to different people! so ill leave the interpretation at that but when i listen to this song, it kinda makes me wana take a really deep breath or something..oh and btw *erasethesun, i totally agree, very soothing song, its kinda like a lullaby to me haha Wonderful song, i was going to do a massive interpretation on the song but it can mean so much to different people! so ill leave the interpretation at that but when i listen to this song, it kinda makes me wana take a really deep breath or something..oh and btw *erasethesun, i totally agree, very soothing song, its kinda like a lullaby to me haha Here's how I interpret this song, its about a man who is desperately in love with a girl, but she can't be with him cause she is already with the so called broken man... and it wears them out... all of em'... dunno... that's how I see it... I think Thom Yorke wrote this song in a vanwhen they were touring in LA, he was amazed at how fake everything and everyone looked there and the video is puuting over how easy it is to look the way you wish or are expected to ( hence the supermarket with body parts etc ).The video was a great way of showing the stark reality. This song has a double meaning to me, unrequited love and materialism. The figure of the song's story (his fake plastic love) lives a life of knowing only love for material things (her green plastic watering can, her town of rubber plans, etc) and has what the narrator feels is a superficial love, founded on material needs and nothing more (her cracked polystyrene man (who used to do surgery for girls in the '80s :P). Despite her trappings, he is madly in love with her, but could never be with her because he has nothing material to offer to her (if I could be who you wanted all the time) so he has to resign himself to watching her live her life without ever knowing true happiness, because he has no way to reach out to her and tell her how he feels without automatic rejection. Sad :( its w/ this guy that wanted to be with this girl, but cant stand her all the time. the times he can, shes good, but his love is not quite the real thing, but he enjoys being with her for the times hes not feeling down. he wants to be that person for u all the time, because he doesnt want to hurt you she also cant stand the times the guy is not cool. the relationship wears him out, and wishes it was true love but is hurt because of his conundrum its w/ this guy that wanted to be with this girl, but cant stand her all the time. the times he can, shes good, but his love is not quite the real thing, but he enjoys being with her for the times hes not feeling down. he wants to be that person for u all the time, because he doesnt want to hurt you she also cant stand the times the guy is not cool. the relationship wears him out, and wishes it was true love but is hurt because of his conundrum I thought the same as samm123 and it had to do with the "fakeness" of something. However, I heard that Thom wrote it about the world of mass marketing and mass consumption. this song is one of the saddest i know. it's about understanding the fakeness in our world. Thom York complete with the fact that it doesn't matter how will you change it and in which way - the underneath, which means the truth will flow up. the suregeries - it doesn't work in the real world - becuase the nature will always win (gravity). and in the ending it came up with some tone which made me feel sorry for him - it's not about being fake, it's about fuel people around. I mean, it's not about  ourself, its about how people will react becuase of the society act. "she's seems so real, my fake plastic love." you know it aint real, but you go with it. Yeah limor is right, this is a very sad song from lyrics to the music. Especially the part that says "If I could be who you wanted all the time" :( I also think that limor's interpretation is awesome, refer to it when you listen to the song! the feeling off being hated by the only person you love, of never being good enough, of having to be fake just to impress someone who'll never care about you anyway. the feeling that you're going to literally explode with emotional pain. man, getting all that into one song is tough. thom yorke is a genius. Capu got out everything that my interpretation of the song would be, that was genius but so sad at the same time. I don't think this was apart of the song but I felt that the "fakeness" that everyone fakes something, so maybe the narrator of the story fakes their feelings because this person won't be with them. However who might this I, he, and she be in the song? I agree with everyone who said that Thom Yorke is a genius, great band... "fake plastic love"? maybe its just about a blow up doll:) (kidding. go radiohead! geniuses.) oh great someone's already made that joke. now i look quite the fool. This song is a post modernists dream!  We are disconnected from the original meanings things and ideas once had, and we are going through the motions.  He connects it to his own relationship.  People get into relationships and do things because they are suppose to and they end up embodying ideals, many times people are disconnected from those ideals, and they don't know why they do the things they do, making everything seem fake.  Hell me too.  Its about alienation, it is similar lyrically to many songs on OK Computer. Onecomment, I think you sumed it all up for us, I was going crazy over the "fakeness" part. Thanks! This song could also be about plastic surgery in our society. The rubber man being the plastic surgeon. "He used to do surgery for girls in the eighties but GRAVITY" What he used to do surgery on much older women but is now doing breast jobs on twenty-year-olds. "She Looks like the real thing. She tastes like the real thing, my fake plastic love." The singer talking about his girlfriend dealing with her insecurities using plastic surgery. "If i could be who you wanted all the time.." The feeling of always trying to impress, and never being good enough that, orthe blow up doll interpretation could also be right. My favorite RADIOHEAD song!!! this is about how people are fake in terms of them having the mentality of just being a follower and being completely fake especially with the ongoing plastic surgery in hollywood For a while I thought this was about a girl that was in a relationship with someone that she didn't really love but there was something about him (money, looks, fame, etc.) that he had that she enjoyed about him. Then the narrator of the song was singing that if he could be what she wanted he wouldn't be a fake lover but instead he has a fake interpretation of her in his mind instead of the "real thing". it's about bullsh#$ in general and how we are all just fake..yes that means me and all other who post here..not our fault hey we are human Totally agree staloki, none of us are perfect and we never will be there are so many things that we all hide. To me, its not about fakeness or anything in that sense. It's either simply enough about an imaginary girl that a guy wants to be with, someone just made up but who's perfect and the sadness of not being able to find her. OR it's about the love of a guy's life who is with another guy, a bloke clearly not good enough for her who is a "cracked polystyrene man". "If I could be who you wanted" Yeah, this is just about consumerism, just another perspective and warning from radiohead.. telling you to find a way to not let it get you. All of their songs are about consumerism and how it has decieved people into caluing emptiness and eventual sorrow. This song was about me and K circa 1995 Thom got our relationship perfectly You may never really know the true inspiration behind lyrics, no matter what you find published on the subject.  Lyrics are almost always subject to interpretation, as music itself is a transmission of feeling - a purging of emotion from the artist with the purpose of affecting emotion on his listener. Today this song for me is serving as a means to help feel my way through the death and dying of two very young parents. Truly the most beautiful,heartbreaking song of our times. It captured me from the first moment i heard it and years later I still get lost in its depth and beauty-the kind of beauty that makes you want to cry. Ive loved reading all these interpritations and I guess as poetry it can mean so many different things to different people. i think its very metaphoric and a soundscape that you get immersed in the sum of all its parts.It really transports you _ I defy anyone to listen to this song and not be moved. One interpritation I was interested in was one I had also considered possible--just the line"he used to do surgery........I see him as a doctor who performed terminations and The GRAVITY alludes to the graveness/ the weight of that responsibility ..... This song is about him being in love with someone he can't have.  The woman he loves lives in a fake world(ie, L.A. where he wrote the song) and lives with a "cracked polystyrene man".  Polystyrene is a plastic used for things like cd cases, platic cutlery and the likes.  It is a colorless unbendable and unpliable plastic.    When he refers to she looks like the real thing... my fake plastic love.  he is refering to his love as fake and platic, not her. This song is truly about trying to be someone you are not.  It's about someone who goes to a place that they are not from...  I'll just spell it out... "Green Plastic Watering Can" = Instructions for the cure "Fake Chineese Rubber Plant" = low self esteem "Rubber man" = CEO "Rubber plans" = Propoganda "Broken man" = Shallow husband "Polyesterine man" = Business Class man "Crumbles and burns" = Ruins his marriage "He used to do surgeries for the girls in the eighties" = He was a breast augmentation surgeon "Gravity always wins" = Breasts get heavy "She looks like the real thing" = SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN REAL "She tastes like the real thing" = BECAUSE SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN REAL "My fake plastic love" = I love you for who you are "I can't help the feeling, I could blow through the ceiling, If I could just turn and run, and it wears me out" = I hate this so much that it drives me to writing amazing songs. Here's what I THINK Thom thought as he wrote this Her instructions for the cure for her low self esteem was probably produced by some CEO of some propagandic company. Her husband is shallow.  He's business class and his facist mindset ruined their marriage.  I guess that's why it's so easy for him to give all those girls breast implants.  They always look fake when it's said and done, anyways. She doesn't need to make herself look "more real" when she's always looked real.  I love her for who she is. I hate the demoralizing standard that we have became as society.  I think I'll write an amazing song about this using tremendously blatent metaphores. _____ And that about sums it up.  Chat w/ me if you've got time DannyECrane@gmail.com this song is forever one of the most important songs in my life. it helped me to avoid starting anything drastic like drugs or suicide. all because of a girl i loved. and she will never understand what she USED to mean to me. now shes just a friend. but then again....you guys prolly dont care. a friend showed this to me for the last stanza(if i could be, who you wanted) and that was what i was like for this girl. I think it's about someone who wants someone else, even though they are incompatible. He still wants to believe that it might work in his head, but if he looks at the truth he can see that it never will. He may not even know this person, much less have spoken with them. the video is amazing. it represents conformity. he's breaking the mold. radiohead is amazing. this song i can really relate to. it's talking about faking who you are and how exhausting it becomes. eventually you fall apart. its about always trying to please others then one day you explode "it gives me this feeling like i could blow through the ceiling" but then you keep pleasing - "it wears me out" Oh dear Operative11, you've got a case of loving yourself. I hope that you truly do. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. This morning I was sure that the song was just sad, observing the world and the people and how fake everything is. Now, rereading/analyzing further, I have some new thoughts. I saw Stranger Than Fiction a week or so ago, and I think an idea that film was trying to get across plays heavily in the meaning of this song (to me). I think there is the slight story of a woman he is in love with that is married, but who has had an affair with him before. This couple however is "fake", somewhat like the the couple someone mentioned earlier that they were housesitting for. Everything in there life is fake, while the narrator feels all too human. Humans are never perfect; "I'm only human" is a common term used when excusing mistakes. Yet someone who is plastic can be molded, like the woman's husband. The narrator, by the end, wishes he too were polystyrene, but he is not--he is human. This whole feeling is both sad (the falseness of the world and people, also the longing for someone you cannot or will not be had) but also comforting, because, like Harold Crick learner--these things, these falsities: rubber plants, watering cans, fake plastic loves and wristwatches, can save our lives. Beautiful. Life is a contract.  Love is a contract.  Human nature dictates that you try to comply and at times this means acting against the way you feel; you try to be the way others want you to be.  Sometimes you can define your whole life that way.  Thom's lyrics are great for introspection & I really need that at times.  Other times, I want to look out, not in. I heard somewhere that this song is about a girl who he is in love with who has breast implants who's husband is a breast implant surgeon. "He used to do surgery for girls in the eighties but GRAVITY always wins" the gravity bit impling that gravity win against the boobs and pull them down lol. I honestly think that Dilloin may be on to something and more than likely that's true with the surgery and plastic and all that. Easily Radiohead's best song.  So powerful and emotional.  After performing this song Thom broke down emotionally from the intense emotions he felt.  I definitely feel his emotions every time I play this song. I've been listening to Radiohead for awhile, mostly OK Computer and a little bit of Pablo Honey. Then I decided to try The Bends, and I heard this song and... Holy fucking hell. I listened to it about twenty times in a row. Almost makes me cry every time. The song is a classic, both musically and lyrically. It is about the decline of indistrialization, a post-industrial town, as well as the futility of vanity, and the need to age gracefully. The need of acceptance. this is a wonderful song, chilling and sad. its hopeless yet captivating. for me it seems to revolve around the world around us. media entertainment. false images and ideas of perfection, things that we strive for but in reality are not easy to attain if not impossible. the theme of relationships also strikes me. trying to be something your not to be with someone whom you love , who you feel for very strongly. to be essentially perfect for them. trying to be something your not. and its makes you weary, we are all guilty of conforming. its impossible not to to a certain extent, we are the world the grow up in. our morals and values and so on. but enough ranting, this song is great. and the music video represents it well. the store , the way everything looks so perfect and fake, bright artificial lights and people. the perfect song to relax and contemplate life to. weather it be the world or deep personal relationships. " if i could be who you wanted , all the time " so touching . . . "If i could be who you wanted all the time." Fake boobs, fake polystyrene people, fake plastic trees and fake plastic everything. I think it's about a guy who's in love with a materialistic woman, and it just suddenly hits him that she's totally shallow and so are all her friends and materialistic and that he has to leave her because of it. first of all, this is a perfect song. it could not be better any other way. this is my take on it and this is how it hits me so choose to read or not. the fake plastic idea and theme to me is obviously about how everyone in this world is fake and "plastic" and no one is real. specifically, i think this song is about how the world's concept of love is sickly distorted and in fact fake. what i visualize when i listen to this song is a world of literally plastic people with only a few "real" ones who have passion unlike the rest of the world we live in. i relate this to my relationship with my girlfriend before we got together. she and i are "real" people who share the passion for music. i feel like i am real through the music i listen to and songs like this one especially. she feels she is real through her violin and classical music. we feel we are connected through music and share our music and our passion. i will go through the verses and how i feel it relates to us. i think the first part of the first verse about the fake chinese rubber plant is somewhat of a metaphor for things that make you busy in life because you have to take care of the plant. some people busy themselves with things that may be "fake" or rubber like the plant. my girlfriend does about a million things and doesn't have much time for herself and is constantly stressed out. which i then link to the line "it wears her out" i view the fake chinese rubber plant as all of the stuff she has to do. the only conflict i have with that is that all of the things she does are for music. music is not fake and especailly in the case of her and i. the rubber man and the rubber town is where we live and the meaningless people we have to go through to get where we want to be.  the town full of rubber plans to get rid of itself is just any old shittown USA that is not going anywhere and every teenager wants to get out of. waukesha wisconsin is one of those towns. she used to be with a broken man. his love was fake. polystyrene is another plastic "fake" reference. he was the kindof guy who partied all the time and was always with other people and eventually cheated on her. though he did this, he claimed he loved her. his love was obviously fake. i'm sorry but i don't know exactly how to describe the part about the polystyreneman and his surgery. the buildup of thom's voice when he says "it wears him out" i think symbolizes when she left him finally. just before the next verse i see maybe the two people who are bound by destiny or something cheesy like that. i see her and i coming towards each other. to me she looks like the real thing, she tastes like the real thing and i try to give her all of my love though the world's love is fake plastic. i believe our love is real though and we have overcome that. the next verse is obvious.  she makes me feel like i could blow through the ceiling. in a good way of course. i try to give all the love i possibly can and sometimes i am not the person she wants me to be. i raised myself on hardcore punk ethics and the "i don't care" mindset towards school. these things do wear me out sometimes. overall i always just wish and try to be who and what she wants all the time. i feel this song really connects to me. i think it is about the fake plastic world and its fake plastic love and if you find real love, even if it isn't for a person, you will become real. i hope this wasn't too cheasy for you, i had to get this out and why not here where people can respond. escape this fake plastic world. This song pierces me every time. When was this song released?Cos this is just the first time i heard it..well better late than never!!and such a sad sad song... when i first listened to this i had no idea what the words were but it made me tear up anyway. that says something. This is what it means to me... It's about UNREQUITED LOVE. fake plants = a love that won't grow no matter how much effort you put into it (watering it). fallng in love with someone who is broken from a previous love, can't let go, and has closed their heart. going after someone like that wears you out. and the best thing for you might be to run away.  "If i could be who you wanted" means to me: if i can be that person your heart was broken for, who you wanted (loved/love). i heard this song is actually about his wife dying two weeks into their being marriage, and its about her. not sure if its true or not I think this song is about surgical enhancements and how some of us would wish we or the people around us could be better looking so that there could be more social and personal acceptance. Check the lines: He used to do surgery for girls in the eighties but GRAVITY always wins and it wears him out. She Looks like the real thing. She tastes like the real thing, Great song! this is a song about a desperated person who wants to be respected, loved, and be loved in return, like every other human being does, BUT he/she cant have it because everyone is judging him/her ONLY for his/her phisical appearance, and not for his/her real personality. and this, my friends, wears out anyone... can someone rewrite these lyrics? There was a big thing in Q magasine a while ago ago, basically writing a paragraph about every song Radiohead wrote, one after the other. This claimed it was inspired by the upper-class parts of Chelsea (an area of London). I always thought it was about how more and more people get careers in making 'fake' products to try and give people happiness, and end up themselves inundated with them. this song is amazing. it challenges a subject which effects all of us. its about how everything is fake even love and he was trying to impress someone by pretending to be someone he's not and its wearing him out. the video is about death apperently. the director said... "The film is actually an allegory for death and reincarnation but if you can read that into it you must be as weird as the people who made it." x he speake about the girl who was so unlucky with her real love ( broken man) she is real but he makes her fall out ,, he is her fake plastic love .... he doesn't like her or wont her to be some one els and that what she can'r live with it any more ....... you can see the start of all the stansa she or her ,, it's about one girl ... thanx something about his voice in this song sounds so sad but hopeful.  it makes me think of so many things that aren't even related to the lyrics at all. everything about it is so full of emotion. it's just a really great song. i saw radiohead the other week, playing in manchester. they were absolutely fantastic, and this song was just amazing in every sense of the word. best radiohead song in my opinion :) Thom said live it was about "Canary Wolf", does anyone know who that might be. Her green plastic watering-can For her fake Chinese rubber plant In the fake plastic earth that she bought From a rubber man in a town full of rubber plans To get rid of itself, it wears her out This verse portrays a woman who lies to herself, and everyone else, about who she is. The phrase about the watering can for a fake tree tells us that she sees the need to do things that she doesn't make sense of, like acting certain ways, just to please people. She lives with a broken man A cracked polystyrene man Who just crumbles and burns He used to do surgery for girls in the eighties But gravity always wins and it wears him out This verse is about a man who also lives a life of lies. He used to be a regular plastic man, but is now a "cracked polystyrene (a commonly used rigid plastic) man." He used to just lie to himself, but the lies have left him broken, or cracked, because gravity - the truth - always gets to him. She looks like the real thing She tastes like the real thing My fake plastic love Everyone lies to them self. You can never know someone for who they really are. Even in love, you rarely can ever know someone truly. But I can't help the feeling I could blow through the ceiling If I just turn and run And it wears me out He could just break free of lies, and be perfectly honest, but nobody does. It wears us all out, living fake lives. If I could be who you wanted all the time If I could be the person you think I am, I would main character is pist off that those people are not fullfild, all becouse of nature, manipulation or maybe the devil him self, true love waits, don't trust anyone suspiciouse:) and no more lies ofcourse This is my favorite song these days....... fucking amazing...... this is like the best song ever i think it could be about alot of differnt things, i mean, everything posted, even the blow up doll comment (thanks for whoever wrote that, i really needed that laugh, not being mean, i just love the way you think) is pretty valid. i think the songs just about people who have been pretending there something that there not for long there just falling apart now, because in the end everything they have is fake and plastic, it could be about a number of things in life, relationships, watching friends, having to come home to a blow-up doll every night, but in the end all the pretending wears you out, makes you crumble and burn "gravity always wins" is such a great way to describe plastic surgery! with the risk of sounding childish - boob jobs methinks I feel like this is about a guy and a girl who both want each other, but they both know that it's wrong. she's willing to change for him (becoming fake), but he's unwilling to let her. He wishes he could be what she wants all the time, but he also knows that it's wrong for either of them to be what they're not. This may be off in a bit of a tangent, maybe its about a girl who's been falling in love with a man who's a fake. He fits the role she desires but its not true to himself and she knows it. The love is meaningless, but they carry on with it like it was nothing. The final part is like being sung from a third person perspective where the narrator feels love for this girl but she doesn't see it because she is too busy being preoccupied by the "cracke polysterine man" Truly insperational, can't stop listening to it. One of Radiohead's best I like the lines "He used to do surgery for girls in the eighties But gravity always wins and it wears him out" Such humor about fake breasts, and how they always slowly go downwards anyway ^^ IMO this song is about everyone. We're all fake in one way or another. Integrity has never been an easy thing for humankind. The woman and man in the song could be any of us. The line about gravity always winning and that it wears him out is a great line. Yes it is a bit humerous, but it's also sad. Think about being that doctor. Day after day, week after week you have people come in and in some desperate attempt to prolong the inevitable or disguise their true age. And each time you have to put on some face telling them they're gonna look great all the while knowing in time, the surgery too will fade and age will win. How do you do that day after day? It's gotta wear you out. "But I can't help the feeling I could blow through the ceiling If I just turn and run And it wears me out If I could be who you wanted all the time" This is the best part of the song. The creshendo and the passion in Thom's voice just plain work. Here is Thom speaking Truth. "If I could just stop being fake, turn around and be real, life would be amazing! If I could love someone truly, without selfishness, without worrying about this or that, but really show true love, well, it wouldn't just taste like it or look like it; no, it would be the real deal. But it's so hard. It's like the world's against that... but... if I could be who you wanted me to all the time, if I could actually be the me I know I could be... just imagine... just imagine..." My only question is, in the first verse, what is the "it" in the "get rid of itself"? I think this songs talks about how people live in an fake world and how people nowadays tend to love fake things because they give them security, popularity and power. The person also talks about the fake love that he has for the girl in the first "couplet" that will never happen (this is why it's fake) and he wants to change himself to please that girl who tends to love fake things. I think the whole message is that we can emphasize on outer beauty in all of our choices but it's always inner beauty that counts in the end. I think this song is more about someone who does everything that she thinks she is supposed to do and its not working out. Shed got the fake plants, and waters them and tries to look like she is living the dream marrying a doctor, but she knows these things arent what MAE love true, they are just all fake, petty things that people think are supposed to make you happier.  People spend to much time worrying about others and if we just concentrate on love and what really matters then we will truly be happy. That's what I get from it at least.

I think it's got something to do with the modelling industry and how they drop you once you get too old. great song...love it. im just going to add onto the plastic doll guy, would it be too much of a stretch to look at greek mythology. more specifically the tale of Pygmalion, who falls so far in love with Aphrodite (goddess of love and beauty) that he sculpts a statue of her. he is only mortal so he cant be with her physically. Aphrodite saddened by Pygmalion’s devotion magically turns the statue to life in the form of Galatea and the two remain lovers till death. but this is not real love as Galatea is just an extended version of the statue, his real love aphrodite is unattainable as he a mere mortal. Alot of the lines relate to this but meh just how i saw it. :D, i just got into radiohead because that's who influenced thrice. The more I listen the more I like. This song is not about him , or a girl ... it's about US. People- ourlives. Making references to the people is either an example or a metaphor. We live in a socitey where we wear ourselves out daily being someone who WE are not- and why? ... Well that we'll have to figure out on our own. When i first heard this song, i thought it was about a doll - a Barbie doll, and the plastic life around her... o.O The more i listen to it, the more i think it's about the consumerist society in which we live, and everything is plastic. Every One is fake, including the 'love' refered to in this song... It's sad. It's also true. PeaceOut. i absolute agree with sundaydriving.......... Every1 check this out...this kinda gives the idea what the song is about. I think this song is sad and true. My opinion is that he gives examples of what he's been trying to do (be something he's not for a girl). It's wearing him out and he's taking a look at the relationship My favourite Radiohead song and 2nd favourite song of all time (Like a Rolling Stone has the top honour).  Lyrically I think this is Thom Yorke's strongest effort.  Sometimes during live performances he introduces this song as being about Canary Wharf--a large commercial development near central London that contains a number of Britain's tallest buildings. If anything it's known for it's sterility and generally banal corporate architecture that could be located anywhere. Now, Yorke is notoriously cryptic and sarcastic when discussing anything about his craft but it's quite possible he derived inspiration from the many fake gardens and trees that dot the underground shopping labyrinths of Canary Wharf.  Or it could mean a million other things taken from his complex imagination.  The classic line "Gravity always wins" could apply equally to the futile battle women wage to keep their breasts perky and upright despite their advancing years, and the fact that those imposing office towers will one day be reduced to rubble.  The general sense of this song is that the faith and hope we put into technology to fulfill our growing needs and achieve a sense of self worth is emotionally and spiritually exhausting and doomed to failure. based on the video alone i think it's pretty clear that it's about mass consumption and materialism. i highly doubt it's literal. She lives with a broken man A cracked polystyrene man Who just crumbles and burns He used to do surgery For girls in the eighties But gravity always wins the broken man represents the corruptness and fakeness in all of us. a fakeness we give into due to the pressures of the society we live in. and 'crumbles and burns' to me is the decline of ones self, the crumbling of our true indentities in a struggle to conform ''all the time''. people desperately try to conform through surgery(amongst other things) and reach the image society depicts as an image of perfection but no matter what extents one will go to,in the end nature,gravity,does take over. revealing the true person behind the chin,cheek and breast implants.but by that point it already ''wears'' you out. both the person undergoing this self induced procedure for the sake of fitting in as well as the person who encourages,supports and performs it. hence, the ''cracked polystyrene ''. a broken indentity or spirit which has been worn down,cracked. She looks like the real thing She tastes like the real thing My fake plastic love But I can't help the feeling I could blow through the ceiling If I just turn and run i think this verse refers to the ocassional success of reaching this standard of perfection and conformity that society creates and sets and how it's our love for this fakeness we live through on a daily basis merely for recognition and acceptance. materialism can become an obsession,our plastic love. although it's clear it's wrong to worship and live by this falsity,if you turn your back on it- turn and run- you know you're risking losing whatever it was that made you give into society's demands. whether it was for acceptance,recognition,respect,acknowledgement of existence,love,friendship; anything. you know that that position will be blown away. but so often,so many of us settle for these superficial values which act as stepping stones on a social ladder that too few chose not to climb in today's consumeristic and materialistic society. if it means they get to be who others want them to be ''all the time'' the fact that the video is set in a supermarket aisle reflects how overwhelming commercialism can be. the man with the handgun could represent those who can't handle this pressure but feel a desperation to live up to it. one thing i can't really tell is if the woman with the hat is talking to the people in the store and watching them through a screen. if so,she could be echoing the voice of mass production which wrongly guides many through life. to me this song embodies the compromise of ones self and their beliefs in order to live up to these expecations,though their individuality is sacrificed; but it is done so willingly,with the awareness of the fake plastic love. So she has a watering-can, and yes, it's green... but for her FAKE CHINESE RUBBER PLANT. As in, an artificial plant that was made in China. Emphasis on "made in China". Rubber = silicone. Get it? :P So she lives with a broken man (Broken as in, he is depressed, he is stupid, etc. hence "Who just crumbles, and burns") and he used to do surgery for girls in the EIGHTIES.. which means he is old, and gravity is used to describe him getting wrinkles, and polystyrene as in he got surgery to fix that, but it still didn't work. ---------------------------------------- "She looks like the real thing.. etc" ^^ I'm guessing a girl got surgery done on herself, and she peers into a mirror but doesn't acknowledge it as that girl being her (That line can be interpreted in many ways) 2. A guy got a girl to get surgery done on herself and made sure that she came out the way he wwanted her to, or the other way around, it could be the girl forcing the guy to do so. 3. etc. ---------------------------------------------------------- "If I could be who you wanted, all the time" ^^ Yeah, self-explanatory.

The song's lyrics are about Canary Wharf (a large business and shopping development in East London) and about the world of mass marketing and mass consumption. From Wikipedia :P i think it tells about how fake our so called SOCIAL LIFE has become, everything is fake, even love.... I reckon that it's about the superficiality of the world. Even back when this was written the world was steadily becoming more fake, more and more people wanting implants all over their bodies. This applies even more now. Some women are having liposuction in their ass and putting in implants to replace it. Real beauty isn't treasured any more. And the romantic guys are getting more and more ignored. I'm one of them, and I am personally getting desperate after 5 years of that romantic creativity rising in me. This album was actually dedicated to this comedian called Bill Hicks who deep inside was a romantic too. He was fucked over by women his whole life until he died young in 94, half a year or so before this song was written. Back then, and these days dramatically more so, every romantic is by definition a hopeless romantic. It's a sad world, and that's what this song connects with. Ohh god! I'm not alone here! God bless you mate for these honest deep words. And thank you for sharing, you made me and made others feel normal...that's for one thing! lol Everything is so unreal that even the trees are fake. Trees are some of the most natural things in the world, but she makes the trees lose that magic. The third verse of thing song resonated with me in a way I cannot fully describe. There was a girl who I was completely in love with, but this never seemed to be enough to make things work properly between us. "She looks like the real thing, she tastes like the real thing, my fake plastic love". Everything should have been right, but it wasn't. When we were together I felt I never got to know the real her, and I think she felt likewise. She was my fake plastic love... so perfect to me that I could never fully open up to her. In the words of Noel Gallagher, "True perfection has to be imperfect", and this imperfection is what we were lacking. It wore me out... Love and heartbreak come and go, but this song will remain as beautiful and meaningful to me as when I first stumbled upon it. If this feeling resonates with any of you, 'Keeping Score' by Mick Flannery also captivates it beautifully I had to make an account just to say I get the same sort of interpretation from this song and verse. The funny thing is I stumbled onto this song the day after I meet her. Also I  like the song you advised. Good use of the quote. Excellent write-up ! The same happened to me. It Really gets you down and when Radiohead best song is about it, it makes it worse. But definitely my favorite song they made along with karma Police The lyrics indicate that the song is about how artificial our world is. The denial of a flawed relationship, caring about a celebrity whose image is purely that of exaggerated gossip from columnists, and even all characters on television and the internet. We cover our eyes from the ominous and hard to categorize world out there will technology and people who live the way we do. We shield our eyes from pain and sorrow with false memory and happiness. We live in a world of fake plastic trees. This song makes me sad. I start to cry. And what a beautiful song it is. Heartwrenching... and so haunting... i think it's just about how the world is so fake these days, and yea it's hopeless. for example, the man who does cosmetic surgery, but they still turn out ugly anyway. it's about how everyone tries to be fake to get ahead in life. Good job. Very informative for me. I think it's saying your wearings yourself out to impress someone to notice you, and it just never works and then your trying to get away from it.  Thom's vocal's are really moving in this, especially in the "I can't help the feeling" part.  It really does make me wanna cry How about the idea that theres a guy involved with a girl and he's just not capable of being anything other than what he is. ie a sensitive, real, soulfull person. Don't we all, on a day to day basis, encounter people who are just completely superficial? apparntly Thom recorded the song and then broke down in tears, the mans a genious I know this is a lyirc site, but this song is a musical masterpiece as well as a lyrical one. The structure of the song is quite simple, but it is the crescendo of the piece that makes it outstanding. It start so gently as Thom sings about the woman, and starts to build at "She looks like the real thing..." to its amazing climax right before the line "But I can't help the feeling...", expressing the songwriters melancholy frustration. The ending collapses back to the original tempo and tone, betraying the hopeless left in its wake. There are a few songs better than this in the world, but not many. being fake wears you out. you cant be someone elses ideal of perfect. I love the way "it wears her out" like the watering can wears her out instead of her wearing it out. Its like the songs saying the fakeness of conseumerism wears us out before the products wear out, cause we throw them away instead of recycle? "To get rid of itself"  again brillant about sustainability and recycling? When he sings "my fake plastic love" im both excited and deeply sad, its poetry :) plastic surgey is obviously refered to and the "if i could be who you wanted all the time" is about body image consumerism etc. BRILLANT :) <3 Radiohead Have everyone ever thought about this That the ‘he’ and ‘i’ was the same person as the man ‘crumbles and burns’,he just died.and i ‘could blow through the ceiling, if I just turned and ran’ for the reason that ‘i’ was dead and wind could blow my ‘cracked polystyrene body’away through the ceiling if my soul just turned and ran. Is tha reasonable? I think its bout how humans are always striving for perfection so to achieve that they make things fake without realising that that just takes all the beauty away and then everything breaks anyway and all you have left is ugly broken things I was at a friend's house the other night and she had put up a fake tree.  I was mildly horrified.  I was being a wee critical of it to another friend when we left the party.  She agreed and so delicately asked the question, "But how can we judge what they have going on in their lives?"  So true.  Who cares what they choose.  I personally would not choose an artificial spruce tree but then again I have a giant elk's head made of balsam mounted on my living room wall.  Who cares.  Live and let live. Interesting song though.  Good job Radiohead. Oh also it makes me think of outer appearances.  So if you choose gigantic fake knockers and you look like a caricature or if you get your face blasted up with liquids and gels and you look ultra weird and puffy then maybe you have crossed the line and you want to retreat a bit.  It's up to you.  If you choose to do botox and you look GOOD and your face operates in a functional manner then more power to you.  I am jealous.  If you choose tasteful small boobs that you like and they make you and a few others happy then goodie gumdrops for you.  Do what you want to do.  Do what makes you - in your opinion - look and feel good.  Who cares?  What truly matters is what is inside... i think its about finding a friend whom he loved from past  still same feelings but its all changed he doesnt know why  true love  has grown in different directions    he didnt understand who she is now  the pressure from himself for social statice and those around him didnt allow him     he took what he saw at face value  without looking for truth    a test of love    i guess he failed     cant see light for the confusion This song mirrors the views I have concerning our mad society and it's obsession with perfection, while totally missing the point of life. How beautifully dismal.. I love you Thom. I agree its about a person who feels they are worthless and is fake to try to get ahead. and how he knows this girl and knows it all but still loves her. idk, but wow one of my fav songs of all time. I'm not going to go over the tune word by word. I think that is counter to the message. This song makes me cry. It is so mournful. Like it is the last song of the dying. It wears me out. It wears me out. Radiohead is absolutely brilliant. I believe this song to be about the corruption and fakeness the world has brought upon itself. That everything wonderful in this world, including love, has been turned into "plastic/rubber" saying that this world is no longer as beautiful and real as it once was. Also, he relates his own life experience to the two-dimensional imposters that were once the leaving, breathing, people of depth that were once amongst us. He also states that "it wears him out". I think he's saying that everything has changed and him/her in the song are so worn out from trying to understand/fix the world of wonder they were once a part of. This song is absolutely amazing and it makes perfect sense. We should all take a good look at ourselves and to learn to reverse this viscious cycle, or eventually we will all be fake plastic people in our fake plastic world living our fake plastic lives. Just coasting through with no depth. This song is dealing with consumerism and taking life for granted. this song kills me.listen to it through headphones in a dark room,it made me shake and i just felt like it took over me and i was so upset but i couldnt bare to turn it off either.my ears where burning i actualy started to sweat.its just like, everything is a lie.and no one will ever change its all so fake so fake, but its ok, its alright were all in it together. Its about being in the state of hopelessness the song is a story about a girl who feels so lonely that she has made up her life I'm confident that this song is about the narrator wanting someone else's wife/girlfriend instead of his current one. The narrator is convinced the girl doesn't belong to the man she's currently with: she's living a fake life. The first verse is a metaphor for (watering) her fake life (with fake love). The second verse is in this 'story' about how the woman is with one of those 'fake' people who do unsatisfying fake work, giving (rich elderly insecure) women fake 'beauty'. The man is actually broken, because in the end he knows his life is a failure, the facts drop onto him, the illusions, the veils always drop in the end through gravity. You can uphold the illusion as long as you want, but in the end, gravity always wins. The third verse is about his own girlfriend/wife. She looks and tastes just like the real thing. The real thing being the true one; the girl he wants, the girl he sings about earlier. His current girl is just to keep him busy, his fake plastic love. (note how this is a reference to coca cola: "The real thing") No matter how much your fake plastic love can be similar to the real thing, in the end its never as fulfilling as the real thing, and you'll be yearning for it. The yearning, even though his fake plastic love tastes and feels just the same, he can't help the feeling to blow through the ceiling, to escape, to run away from his fake life, and that wears him out. The illusion is wearing him out. And then, "If I could be who you wanted all the time" can make some people shed a tear. The high pitched "be" is heart breaking. He just wants to be with the girl, and just wants her to feel the same. To be honest, this is not about mother earth or materialism, and its pretty biased and stupid to think that...  Ah well. Opinions, i guess. and if I could beeeee........ i think this songs about infatuation and the loss of meaning in the word love. I can't help the feeling. I COULD BLOW THROUGH THE CEILING!!! But gravity always win... Well said, Thom. Quote Thom himslf 'This is a song about Canary warf' This song meansï»¿ a lot to me; Personally it's about not being able to fit in or be liked when all you're doing is being yourself. Fake plastic trees. Double negative, it's a real tree. In an environment where fake tree's are preferred. He's trying to fake a character so he can fit in, but never will. So he acknowledges himself as forever different. the song is about canary wharf Hi I think it's about trying to make someone happy, and he can't. In a time full of rubber plans to get rid of herself. she's kinda suicidal... he's with her... he wants to be enough for her... it kills him that she's so unhappy and he can't be real enough for her. In the same way that Big Yellow Taxi is not about a carpark, this song is not about a shopping development. "I don't care what Thom says" 1.O_o 2.Then why you on song meanings? "I don't care what Thom says" 1.O_o 2.Then why you on song meanings? I agree with IKI. There's a version of this song I heard once in which he cries in the ending. Why would he cry if it was about something like that? It's about consumerism & superficiality, and how it basically screws over the world. Note that it's "a fake Chinese rubber plant", to me hinting at those little "Made In China" stickers you see everywhere suggesting sweatshops and globalization. Basically, the message is that nobody cares about truth or meaning any more... they all just want what's cheap and looks nice. The girl acts just like a "real" girl (i.e. someone with their one opinions, dreams etc. not force-fed to them by corporate or government interests), but she's a conformist, and so she's fake as a plastic tree. Of course, he still loves her, but he can't "be who she wants" because he's not "plastic" like her. It's quite tragic. It's about fake love, fake life. I also thinked Radiohead sneaked a boobs reference in here, "He used to do surgery, for girls in the 80s, but gravity always wins." :D their boobs will always be sagging.... *sigh* this is clearly about how superficial everything is. he talks about being broken polystyrene, which is basically Styrofoam. and i do agree with marston20 about the plastic surgeon, it only makes sense with all the other references that everything is fake, and i think his meaning is that it is all wearing thin, it all corrodes and disappears over time, we need to do something that sticks, something that won't fade with time, but everything does... nowadays, no one cares of whats real, only what's beautiful and "buyable". thats what the song is about, you can buy everything and put it in a supermarket car -hence the video- anyways, it makes me think that it is about two people in love, but she wants to forget him, since he's not beautiful and she is already married to a rich and well-succeeded man(who is also in a crisis, because he just found out his work was worthless). "my fake plastic love" doesnt mean the love isn't real, but that even though she is fake and plastic, he still loves her, what makes him sad and mad at himself, trying to forget her. <3 radiohead I see this song as saying that the world has because commericalized and man has come to believe that he has a control and creation in everything (because isn't plastic "man-made"?) so therefore humans think that they have a god-like power over everything on Earth. and then the people who don't see it continue on obliviously, and the people who do see the truth are worn and tired by it because it taints everything else when they realize they can't be in control (since we seem to have the thought of superiority) and humans will die and pass on like many other species before it. pretty much just saying we think the universe is in the palm of our hands when we are really in it's control in my interpretation. One of the most beautiful yet heartbreaking songs I've ever heard. The superficial society we live in today is hardly anything we can physically live up to, so we fake it and continue to live as dolls in a superficial world, watering fake plants and choosing fake love in fear of never finding the real thing. What other choice do we have? For me it is about someone somehow "trapped" in a relationship with someone he's not sure how to feel about. "she looks/tastes like the real thing" means his desire to be able to accept her and stay, but he can't help "the feeling" that he can "blow through the ceiling", that is, fly, if he just "turn and run" from her. Basically, he thinks he can do better and that's what wears him out. "if I could be who you wanted". He cannot love her, although she looks like (and could be) the one. It is about superficiality in first person. I like the way it sounds. materialism, superficial life/love etc. In my opinion I think the main principal of this song is that you can't conquer love. You may fall in love with someone because "she looks like the real thing" and "she tastes like the real thing" but she's not the woman/person that you will be happy with forever because she will wear you out. And you can also wear her out too. Because the only way to conquer love is for that person to want you more than anything else. @satansplitoris What the fuck are you rambling about? In my opinion this song says, that there's no complete or absolute happiness for no one, it wears him out, it wears her out, it wears me out, no matter how bright your life is or could be, at some point you'll face nostalgia for old good times. At the end he gets deep in the sad feeling, of being with someone who doesn't give love in return , "if i could be who u wanted...all the time", with some frustation for it "but I can't help the feeling", looks like he can't get more from her no matter the effort. Great song, sad, can't stop getting goosebumps when I hear it. I think the songÂ´s about love, first talks about a fake plastic world and life like the one most people live, then he  talks about that woman he deeply loves, and how she has is also part of a fake plastic world, cause itÂ´s what society gives us not precisely what we want. Then he starts talking about this guy who is just as plastic as everyone else and heÂ´s with her (can be the same who is in love or someone else, not sure), then he starts talking about her, as he can see her, not as fake as everything is supposed to be, but real. Then heÂ´s just sad, depressed, cause itÂ´s all the same stuff, it has to be all plastic, he wants her to be with him, but they are different, cause though she is human she doesnÂ´t see it, she just follows what other people follow, and he wishes he could either run away from all that or simply just be what she expects him to be. And itÂ´s like the whole fake plastic society, requirements and vision of life wears everyone out, especially when you are not like that.

The interpretation of this song as being about a man and his blow-up doll is just really sad and depressing... Heh, this song is about Thom's home and childhood. About his mother betraying the family and putting trust in all the material layer of life, money. She can't achieve the goals she planned to, she is miserable and unfulfilled with no emotion on face. Thom wants love, he needs love of his mother, but she chooses his brother, his brother ain't so emotional, ain't so beautiful but he gets more approval. Thom's father is working hard for the family. Doing his best for the sake of his children and woman whose presence doesn't make him happy anymore. He devotes totally to his job. Human being needs approval, needs respect which he looks in his job not family. He used to be a different man before marriage, maybe even in the very beginning of the marriage. But wrong choice made him that way, he got hurt by this woman. Thom's just a kid. He's very emotional kid. He looks up to his parents, but what they show him is plastic. No emotions. No family. What he sees is real. What he tastes is real. She's his imagination, the voice in his head that tells him what's real. He wants to get out of this house. But he can't. He is too sensitive to leave his parents and let them be. Even if they show him all the time he's not what they wanted. If only he could be who they wanted... This song is about why Thom Yorke is great, TRUE artist. It's about real him. I believe there are people like me who understand him and are artists too but they don't care to put comments like that in place like that which I wouldn't do too if it hadn't been for something that happened today in my life. Thom if you ever read this comment which I doubt I would like to thank you for helping me understand the world and survive. Heh, this song is about Thom's home and childhood.

Thom if you ever read this comment which I doubt I would like to thank you for helping me understand the world and survive. he's a guy.. who is in love with a girl he can never have, cause he isn't what she wants.. obviously. and everything around her is fake.. she lives with fake people and she knows how fake it all is.. she hates it.. and everyone around her hate the fact that no matter how hard and fake they get, they cant make it perfect.. he knows all that.. and he knows how real she is.. that's why he loves her its an amazing song that i will never get over <3 The gravity of the "operations on young girls" (abortion?) has made the guy ir-reversibly broken. Because of this, their relationship has been broken for sometime.  Both are carrying on in a "fake plastic" world where, she lives in total denial and continues to construct her plastic world, he recognizes the "state" she is in (because of him), but doesn't have the strength to run from it. The daily denial just wears them out...as it would on anybody... I dont know if i'm right or wrong, but i think its about a person who loves someone else for who they think they are, however it becomes overwhelming for him and he wants to end it but he knows he can't Not sure if thats wright but thats MY interpretation of it. What I get from the song is that in life people is never happy with what they have and they always want something else, something that for some reason we cannot have. To me this song is a paradox. I want YOU but you want HIM and he wants HER. I think this song's about how nothing is real anymore, not even the plants. everyone's fake and because they are all "made of plastic" they are so easy to break and have no clue who or what they are, they just follow the fashion. DanielXcc (11.19.10), I hope you have it correct because thus far your explanation makes the most sense to me. This song, by such a great band, has always confused me (although that's easy to do:). We put so much time and energy being something oyher than our real selves and trying to be what we think others want. And it's a waste of time because we walk around always knowing who we are; we cannot escape ourselves. Sure, where were you when I needed the lyrics explained:) There are so many comments and I can't read them all but I'm going to say what I think anyway. On the surface it seems to be about a stereotypical young woman who gets too much plastic surgery to make herself look good and her plastic surgeon husband. But I think you could bring it a little deeper and say it's about two people in a reltionship who feel like they have to fake how they really feel, I suppose make themselves look happier with each other than they really are? That I guess is where the "It wears him/her out" bit comes in and "If I could be, who you wanted." Having to fake all the time and covering up how they really feel is wearing them out. After watching the video clip, maybe the song could have a double meaning? To me, the video clip reminds me of a political comment about people wanting designer babies.  How people want their children looking perfect, or sporty, and Thom York is in the shopping trolley as a metaphor for people potentially willing to shop for DNA strands to make their child "perfect."  Therefore, the title "Fake Plastic Trees" could also mean the old metaphor of growth and their child starting off as a seed, before growing into a fake plastic tree, as their parents have selected what they will be good and and how they will look. Just an idea.  I know it doesn't have too much connection to the lyrics, moreso the music video clip. 'If i could be who you wanted all the time, all the time' i think this shows that the most awful thing about the fakeness is that it is known in all minds that it isn't going to really change the real thing. also, the frustrating part is that this knowledge doesnt change the fact that people want to escape from theirselves.. I don't think Thom wrote it for someone. Or lets say the narrator is speaking to someone. He's talking about life in general. And how we put up with bullshit. But as if he's describing some girl and the man who she lives with.....and nobody is shallow nor deep. She is accepting the fake kind of lives that society keeps us in, and she's depressed, she doesn't like it, she never tries to change though. AND the other AND Thom AND everybody...we're a Prozac Nation....but yet we feel things every now and then. Things we can't explain. I don't know why, but this song perfect with my situation. I fell in love with a girl ho had a total different value and view with me, but still I love her. But this love endure like one month, and I suddenly found yes, this is the my "fake plastic love"! And I tried to be friend with her and it turned out we get into worse situation and all thing i think now is if i can be who she wanted all the time. But still, it's the fake love part impress me the most that shows how ugly I am, I used to think I am kind of guy who treat every relationship with all my heart. But now, it is only fake. Great band. Good song about a person who does not find herself valuable (or valuable enough). She believes she would have to put on an act to please the other person...that she couldn't just be herself. I think she lost herself long ago. Instead of valuing all her amazing attributes and successes, she concentrates on her failings...her warts. She holds no trust for people and therefore cannot understand how who she is (the real her...the good, the bad, and the ugly) could be desired unless she can wear a mask. Her mask is difficult to remove, but I have an idea the woman in the song is overall stunning...that the qualities she does have that make her shine (genuine shine...not the qualities created to manipulate) are so incredibly special and unique that they make her worth all the hurdles her insecurities cause her to create so people will stay at arm's length. What is fake and plastic about her is her game. What is beautiful is her soul, only she cannot see it. She believes others will dump her the moment she faulters or fails for she has no faith in others, just as she has no faith in herself. She cannot trust and never will trust; therefore, she will always have what she has now. She will always get the same results. All successes will be temporary. All relationships will be fleeting. But  she'll go with that because it's less challenging emotionally and she can always replace lovers...her physical beauty along with her brains and her game will ensure a long never-ending line of potential lovers. The last line of the song is at the root of the entire song's meaning: she doesn't like herself, cannot imagine that anyone could like (much less love) the real person under the mask; and she is too emotionally frightened to try for she believes she'll end up losing someone she actually loves. VERY sad song about a very sad attitude, but what cha gonna do. Nothing anyone can do except eventually walk away and leave her to her choices. It's like WALL-E's life ! this song to me its sending a message to the world about how fake we have become, natural beauty isnt important to us, everything must be perfect and synthetic. fake trees, fake flowers synthetic grass, almost anything now a days can be synthetic and we embrace it as beautiful. women they get all kinds of surgeries to try and make themselves beautiful with out knowing that they were born naturally beautiful. fake eyelashes they dye their hair and all kinds of shit... the second and the third verse are so meaningful to me, a surgeon is broken because he finally realizes that no matter what he does, gravity and age always win, and that wears him out the third verse the singer realizes that he is stuck in the same dilema and he knows it, he as well as the rest of the world is have found beauty in fake synthetic things, and forgotten about the beauty of natural things... hes got a ''fake plastic girl'' meaning that she probably has some surgeries fake tits or something. she feels like the real thing, she tastes like the real thing, my fake plastic girl.... but he starts thinking that if only he could scape this mental state, and start appreciating natural beauty again he would feel free... ''but i cant help the feeling, i could blow thru the ceilling if i just turned an ran... and it wears him out, cuz he knows hes also stuck in the same situation in a world that doesnt appreciate natural beauty anymore i made a mistake, i ment fake plastic love, his lover He wants love so bad in his life, that he is willing to 'fake' falling in love and he's lying to himself. In the beginning of the song he's reflecting on how he thinks his life will turn out (from the girls perspective) if he pursues this fake love. He knows it's the wrong the, but he 'can't help the feeling, that he'll burst through the ceiling if he turns and runs' from this fake love. He wants to love so bad that if he turns away he might not forgive himself and he's left with this dilemma that 'wears' him out. This girl may love him and he's left with an option to either be with or marry her. Although he wants love, he knows it isn't love and he wishes he could be what she wanted. Her husband/lover.  This is my interpretation! This video give a while new perspective on this great song, look at the description to get an idear of what you are watching I think this song is about mother earth nature and how it's slowly dying because of human waste and abuse. "It wears her out"-Her as in mother nature. It brought me this idea because Thom Yorke is actually an active environmentalist. He refuse to fly to his shows and only use low emmiting diode lights to his shows. It's about fear. Seems to me he has love for this girl.. Whether in a attracted way or maybe even a girl in his family.. She lives in a fake world with a fake man that's a surgeon that's probably an azzhole but Thom is trying to say even if he's a surgeon and probably refering to him being wealthy, Gravity always wins so who cares.. He's nothing. And it wears all of them out including him.. So before he blows to the ceiling, he turns and runs for some reason. And in the last verse he's regretting not being there all the time with her. This is my all-time favorite song!!!  I find it to be soooo beautiful, whimsical and deep. I think the meaning can be correctly interpreted  in many different ways. To me, it's about about wanting some sort of stable "perfection" and doing everything to maintain it, even by means of  plastic surgery, "but gravity always wins." We all grow old and die. Love that seems like it can go on forever, often doesn't. Without flaws and imperfection, everything would be fake, shiny, boring and predictable - like plastic. To me, the song is about how absolute perfection doesn't exist - and perhaps it's a good thing that it does't, for we don't want to live in "a fake, plastic earth.." He loves her but she loves money more then any other thithinghe feels so sad cause he wants her so bad but he knows she's not the right person for him but can't stop thinking of how she might feel at the end of the day and that wears him out , he knows that she loves him somehow but he has nothing in a fake plastic world and he can't do anything about it , so he cries and cries and at the end he doesn't hate her cause he really loves her and just hopes things get better for him . He tries so desperately to make things work out even when he already knew it's just really hopeless. It's like he has created his own "fake world," out of desperation, where he imagines himself just being with her and sharing a love that's not even mutual and real. "A green plastic watering can For a fake Chinese rubber plant In the fake plastic earth" This is talking about how everything is fake in life by making reference to the fact that people even buy fake plants. "That she bought from a rubber man In a town full of rubber plans To get rid of itself" The "rubber man" is a salesman, because salesmen are often superficial and only care about getting your money and not actually about whether you will actually be satisfied.  In fact, the entire town is superficial, filled with gossip (the "rubber plans to get rid of itself," because if people actually did all the things they talked about, the town would probably be destroyed). "And it wears her out It wears her out It wears her out It wears her out" Pretty straightforward- she is fed up with all the superficiality in her life "She lives with a broken man A cracked polystyrene man Who just crumbles and burns" Her husband (or the man she lived with) is emotionally worn and stressed with being fake as well.  Polystyrene (or "styrofoam") is a very weak artificial material that cannot take much strain.  However it is important to point out that the man, while cracked and worn, is still made of polystyrene.  So even though he is worn out and dissatisfied, he still refuses to change his superficial ways. "He used to do surgery For girls in the eighties But gravity always wins" He's a retired plastic surgeon, which means that he is pretty wealthy, but he's spent his entire life making other people fake as well.  People went to him to hide their aging, and they were angry with him when it their face lift didn't look as nice ten years later because "gravity always wins."  If you need good looks to be happy, you will always end up dissatisfied in the end. "And it wears him out It wears him out It wears him out It wears" He too is not happy with the condition of society and wants it to change, yet he won't do anything about it. "She looks like the real thing She tastes like the real thing My fake plastic love." The narrator's girlfriend is perfect at first glance, but she is actually just as fake and superficial as the rest of them. "But I can't help the feeling That I could blow through the ceiling If I just turn and run" Here we discover that the narrator too is putting on a mask or a fake personality for this girl.  He has this fleeting feeling that maybe if he left the relationship and stopped being fake, he could do so much better than her. "And it wears me out It wears me out It wears me out It wears me out" He stays in the relationship, out of fear and uncertainty. He is still unhappy, but he has accepted the fact that nothing will change. "If I could be who you wanted If I could be who you wanted All the time All the time." In fact, he goes even further.  He wishes he actually WAS the person he pretends to be for her.  He is so used to acting a certain way to impress her that he is unhappy with himself.  Not exactly a happy ending. Basically this song is about the screwed up condition of society, told from the point of view of someone who is part of the problem.  Everyone gets so hung up on superficial, meaningless crap, and nobody is true to themselves.  Everyone is tired and fed up with it, but nobody does anything about it, so society continues to be fake and life continues to be stressful and purposeless. "This is a song about an area in east London called Canary Wharf which was landscaped with a lot of artificial plants.[3] Radiohead singer Thom Yorke said "Fake Plastic Trees" was "the product of a joke that wasn't really a joke, a very lonely, drunken evening and, well, a breakdown of sorts".[2] He said the song arose from a melody he had "no idea what to do with". Unlike his usual approach of either keeping note "of whatever my head's singing at the particular moment" or forcing "some nifty phrases" he devised onto the melody, Yorke said that creating "Fake Plastic Trees" was the opposite. He said, "That was not forced at all, it was just recording whatever was going on in my head, really. I mean, I wrote those words and laughed. I thought they were really funny, especially that bit about polystyrene".[4] The song incorporates the melodic leap heard on the word 'high' in Rocket Man by Elton John." I always think the main comment should contain what the writer/artist actually said THEN other interpretations. I much prefer the ambiguity. I feel that most of radioheads songs have more then one meaning and more then one correct interpretation. Hence quality writing lol. So on the one hand Thom may write about an area in east london that had a lot of artificial plants while reserving a deeper meaning, So in essence he probally saw all this and thought how weird and strange is the fact that everything is so fake here and then as he thought about it in his drunken lonely state other feelings came into play and it became so much more. I feel that is one of the reasons Radiohead is such a talented band, they know how to write great music full of meaning on many different levels, Not to mention how instrumentally gifted they are as well. This is about a man who witnesses fraudulence. He says the woman in the first verse is a liar - Her life is a falsehood: her green watering can is plastic, -She has grown into it: she waters her fake plant with a fake watering can, and even her reality is not real: In the fake plastic earth. Her green plastic watering can for her fake Chinese rubber plant In the fake plastic earth She is fake, she adds to fake, and she doesn't know reality anymore. Something that needs to be mentioned is that being this is radioheads 2nd actual album release (the bends) that in their first Pablo Honey they spent so much time and effort on mixing the tape etc etc that the tempo does not emphasize the lyrics nearly as much as this one does. With an actual studio handling all of the extra work a lot of their songs on this album will change in tempo at certain parts that emphasize the lyrics, Paranoid Android is a great example of this as it's a song about growing anger. I also feel this song mirrors a tempo and lyric comparison as do my iron lung and probably others. I feel that Radiohead especially in this album really focused on this aspect with their music. So sad, brooding and piercing. Im 21 and Iranian, I love a girl that she lives in another city and even I can't tell her my feelings... I can wait for her 100years but don't know her feelings toward me. I'm afraid her feelings are not the same and Im in limbo somehow. I think every girl beside my love is fake for me... Like some posters have said before, fake love (maybe you think it is real love for a while, but it might be a temporary thrill of just "having someone"), trying to fit in with the expectations of society, all that. It's all plastic. A sad thing to realize and it makes you really feel truly alone. In my opinion this is necessary before you can find real things. Still then, even with real things in your life that make you truly happy, it can be difficult (impossible?) to escape the pressure of society and the fakeness to which it translates and this can "wear you out" at times. we are all fake in some way or another, but sometimes its ok to be fake i guess. i mean we dont hafta to be totally alienated from society all the time, but we dont hafta conform all the time my 2 cents... ok. im going with the doll theory. anything about a blow up doll brightens my day. and when my day is brightened, the whole world is too. (sarcasm) I agree its about a person who feels they are worthless and is fake to try to get ahead. and how he knows this girl and knows it all but still loves her.  idk, but wow one of my fav songs of all time. this song makes me cry.. for me its about a break up, and this person is really missing the girl who broke up with him. Here's how I interpret this song, its about a man who is desperately in love with a girl, but she can't be with him cause she is already with the so called broken man... and it wears them out... all of em'... dunno... that's how I see it... all your comments are stupid and not worthy to be read point blank I'm not sure what's the real meaning of the song, but to me it's about online relationships. Even if you do really love the person you met online, you know it's fake. It isn't real, it can't be. But you want it to be real so badly you just keep playing along. I guess it just makes more sense to me, personally. Read Baudrillard's work on Simulacra.  Everything falls victim to the virtual, even our most private inner feelings like love. its definitely about a blow up doll.... its about him being useless and unwanted and "broken" thusly has a blow up doll to satisfy his needs powerfuly displays how sometimes we all get worn out by being fake. beautiful song and always will be... never thought about the lyrics much ive been reading these comments and the lyrics back and forth... it sounds to me when he refers to "my fake plastic love" he means a girl who had alot of plastic surgery etc.. hmmmmm alanis morissette's cover is better than the actual radiohead one!!!! and i love radiohead!!! Hate to disagree, but... I do.  :P Heh, this song is about Thom's home and childhood. About his mother betraying the family and putting trust in all the material layer of life, money. She can't achieve the goals she planned to, she is miserable and unfulfilled with no emotion on face. Thom wants love, he needs love of his mother, but she chooses his brother, his brother ain't so emotional, ain't so beautiful but he gets more approval. Thom's father is working hard for the family. Doing his best for the sake of his children and woman whose presence doesn't make him happy anymore. He devotes totally to his job. Human being needs approval, needs respect which he looks in his job not family. He used to be a different man before marriage, maybe even in the very beginning of the marriage. But wrong choice made him that way, he got hurt by this woman. Thom's just a kid. He's very emotional kid. He looks up to his parents, but what they show him is plastic. No emotions. No family. What he sees is real. What he tastes is real. She's his imagination, the voice in his head that tells him what's real. He wants to get out of this house. But he can't. He is too sensitive to leave his parents and let them be. Even if they show him all the time he's not what they wanted. If only he could be who they wanted... This song is about why Thom Yorke is great, TRUE artist. It's about real him. I believe there are people like me who understand him and are artists too but they don't care to put comments like that in place like that which I wouldn't do too if it hadn't been for something that happened today in my life. Thom if you ever read this comment which I doubt I would like to thank you for helping me understand the world and survive. Sorry for the triple comment, something weird happens with the site :\ Trees = parents I must have a dirty mind because I always thought the line "he used to do surgery for girls in the 80's" meant that he used to deflower girls in his younger stud days and the gravity line was more "what goes up must come down" now that he has gotten older. I never thought of those lines being as literal as people are saying. I think it is the word "girls" which doesn't seem right for cosmetic surgery that largely sees aging women. gross Interesting takes by most people here. Here is my very 'unemotional' and literal interpretation of the song. Possibly envy? You be the judge. The song is about a plastic female doll who is being played with by a child (boy?). The doll is probably part of some doll-kit (hint: rubber man, broken polystyrene doctor doll, plastic grandmas). With me so far? Good... The first time the doll observes the child getting tired. The second time the doll observes that the doctor-doll is wearing out (after all, it is cracked). The third time the doll states "I am getting tired of this game". While the doll loves the child, the child just uses the doll as a toy (I can break through the ceiling of a plastic house!) The destructive child (boy or girl?) is breaking the doll. Finally, the (broken?) doll asks itself the question "If I could be who you wanted.." This makes me cry! It's about a girl who's completely fake cause she's having to be someone she's not: "If I could be who you wanted all the time..." Awww :( She can't be herself because she feels the world won't accept her that way, so really she has no idnetity. :( yeah, you're a bit right, it's actually about a girl that's gonna have some fake boobs, because she's going to have a plastic surgury andit also explains a bit about the surgeon thats going to do her surgury. Thom once said, this song is about Canary Wharf, which is a town where you can get easily a plastic surgury. it wears me out... hah hope none of you peeps came here looking for coca cola Well I think (and I could be wrong) the song's about blues singer Janis Joplin and he just thinks her voice is so fake, yet sometimes he wants to be with her.  That's basically what I got out of it. I think it's a song about telling her she is still looked up to with awe...for her beauty, her brilliance, and her creativity. She still inspires others. None of that has changed. She'd still cause stuttering among the masses. One does not have to wear a mask to be impressive. Eventually the mask fails. It's when that person can still see her reflection shining in the eyes of another after the mask is dropped that she knows loves...and she knows all that comes with love: friendship; loyalty; understanding; acceptance; and even a firm kick in the ass at times to awaken the mind and spirit. LOL. Great song. Great band. The Bends is like the ocean at a little lonely beach in Santa Cruz, on a starlit night, all by yourself. You see the stars dance and play on the water's face, you hear the rush of the tide, but is it high or low? You don't know, but you test the water, feel its steel coldness. You're scared, but the tempation of finally feeling something new and fresh is too enticing, so you venture further. The water pulls and pushes at your feet, and as they go numb, the tears well up inside you and you dive in. And the stars play on your face, and the waves take you away. I don't think anybody's brought up this point yet, but he also describes the people as being made of rubber, and I know somebody mentioned blow-up dolls earlier, I think they were right to an extent. But I don't think it's a blow-up doll, but a normal, pretty doll. If you've ever seen a child playing with a doll they actually talk to it and pretend it's real. I think that's what the song is about. I think he's just trying to have a reltionship with a woman who's pretty and seems perfect, but she's a fake and superficial as a doll. Also, she's always around somebody who supports (and is employed by) people being so superficial and caring what other's think. He lives that way himself. This song to me represented Thom's growing dark vision of the commercial Utopia that eventually became OK Computer. I've always felt this was Thom's cry against a world that he viewed as demanding false outward representations of ourselves, yet inwardly we are all tired and lonely and just wanting to be accepted. If you take this song in context of OK Computer, then you can relate the song to a world filled with rubber plans to get rid of itself - or in other words a world where we replace the real with fake replicas. An orwellian world that is Fitter Happier... more productive... filled with tansports, motor ways and tramlines... a world where ambition makes you look pretty ugly ... with kicking sqealing gucci little piggies. That world really did wear Thom out... he felt like a sardine in a limousine can and one of the reasons why Kid A stands as his breaking point. The reason why he cried the first time he heard the album all the way through - sitting in the backseat of a car. "I will see you, in the next life..." Ah yes, this song is simply scrumptualescent!! So good I can barely mooove............................................................ Thom Yorke is obviously the greatest lyricist to ever inhabit this sad excuse of a habitat that we call "Earth".... According to Radiohead, this song is sung for the world of mass marketing and mass consumption. It seems as though Thom is tired of society being so materialistic, resulting in a society with no depth or sincerity. I also concur with the comments above on how society, the people, are so superficial, and attitudes and personalities have become a tool to be used to get ahead in life.  Simply genius. Oh, and erasethesun, if you think this song puts you to sleep, you should listen to No Surprises. Another masterpiece. Speaking of masterpieces, the greatest of all masterpieces - Paranoid Android i think this song is kind of three parts the first part is thom commenting on how superficial everyone is, and how they get so tired of being fake. then the second part is saying how his love for this girl is fake, even though it seems so real and intense. hes realizing that his most intense emotions are still superficial, and it "wears him out." then the last part is simply "if i could be who you wanted, all the time." i think that line is kind of ironic, because throughout the whole song he was complaining about how fake everyone is. but in reality, he WANTS to be "fake" (ie not himself, but what she wants him to be) so she'll love him. Maybe thats the only unsuperficial thing, he just wants her to love him. This is the type of song that your can start listening to happy and confident, and by the end of the song feel empty and lonley. This is song seems to have amazing effects on it's audience. It says a lot for the power of this song that I can barely bring myself to listen to it because it makes me feel so down - and then I listen to it anyway! It's so beautiful and so tragic, it's literally a work of art. I can't offer anything besides that; it's amusing how many people (me included) haven't attempted to provide actual interpretations, but that's how good the song is! I think the song is pretty straight forward. Everything is so fake and everyone troies so hard to maintain it and themselves. Defeating the purpose of life. And it ends up destroying them when i hear this song i think of barbie dolls, and suburbs and green rubber gardening boots. why? well, the barbie dolls, because, isn't it obvious? they're the poster children for fake plastic-ness. the suburbs because i hate the suburbs. they're all the same. all the families are the same, all the people are the same: the stay at home moms with the working dads and the hockey-playing kids. and the gardening boots because of the fake rubber plants. i love this song My 2c: I think the lyrics are all about imagery, rather than a single character. I think people are trying to analyse the song a bit too specifically and personally - the characters seem to me to be metaphors for modern Western culture, I don't think the song is really about anyone. So the significance of the "broken man" is the futility of his life's work (Gravity always wins) not that he's married to, or the doctor of, the female character mentioned earlier. Their relationship is kept vague, it's not what the song's about. You can certainly see how places like Canary Wharf or LA might have inspired this song. The lyrics seem more evocative than narrative to me, they're painting a picture of our world as materialistic and fake. Fake plastic trees of the kind found in hotel lobbies are the main image (you can almost see Thom walking past them in some swish hotel and coming up with the inspiration for the song!) - the metaphor is then extended to other things and people (rubber man, fake plastic love, polystyrene man, rubber plans etc.) to suggest that in some way they're as fake as the plastic plants though they look and taste "like the real thing" - wouldn't surprise me if that's a swipe at Coca-Cola either. The last part of the song seems pretty self-explanatory, it's clearly a more personal take on it and has been covered adequately above. :) I really see a connection between this song and Creep. I think both explore the idea that sometimes we value other people's expectations more than our own. We don't have realistic images in our minds. IN the beginning he talks about "green plastic watering can," maybe showing that synthetics are good for tools and things that improve our lives, but not good to use for fixing problems of self-image. I think with the "fake plastic love" he's referring to lust, and how sometimes we can't control it, thus the "But I Can't Help The Feeling." I see this song as questioning humanity's view of reality. It raises questions like, What if we could just manufacture humans, would they be human? What is true love? What's the difference between love and lust? Can we really tell if something's or somebody's real or fake? People wear themselves out by not being true to themselves, and I think this really comes through in the lyrics. Sometimes we just have to accept who we are and trust that we can't satisfy everyone, even the ones we love. The first part of the song is a criticism on consumerism. It’s about people that buy things or try to achieve a perfect image to fit the standards of a consumer society, thinking they’ll find happiness that way, but then realize their lives are empty and superficial. Then he talks about himself. He admits that he has done the same thing. He tried to build a relationship out of a feeling that wasn’t really there, just because it fit an image of happiness. And he could almost make himself believe it was real. Plastic is a metaphor for things that look like something real but are actually fake. When he says ‘if I could be who you wanted, all the time’ at the end, he’s referring to achieving a certain image before society, but also to the need we have to make another person happy because then maybe we can find happiness and meaning in our lives too. People want to believe they love someone and they want to be needed and loved, and sometimes they’ll refuse to face reality in search of an ideal. It’s impossible to be who someone else wants all the time, but people try because they are lonely and life has no meaning. The song illustrates the materialisation of the world. People are less guided then before by values. They are loosing their soul through this materialist world. People are getting more plastic, less human. The video illustrate members of the band beeing «bought» by costumers, illustrating the concept of an human looking more and more like a product, not like a human anymore. An empty plastic product. The song is the story of a man who sees his neighbor and the life she lives.  He sees the futility of her life and wishes he could save her, he wishes that he could make her life better.  He thinks if this had been before when he was younger it would be different, but hes not, its to late for him, its to late for her.  She lives her fake plastic life, and he lives in his wanting something thats not real. IMO this song is about everyone. We're all fake in one way or another. Integrity has never been an easy thing for humankind. The woman and man in the song could be any of us. The line about gravity always winning and that it wears him out is a great line. Yes it is a bit humerous, but it's also sad. Think about being that doctor. Day after day, week after week you have people come in and in some desperate attempt to prolong the inevitable or disguise their true age. And each time you have to put on some face telling them they're gonna look great all the while knowing in time, the surgery too will fade and age will win. How do you do that day after day? It's gotta wear you out. "But I can't help the feeling I could blow through the ceiling If I just turn and run And it wears me out If I could be who you wanted all the time" This is the best part of the song. The creshendo and the passion in Thom's voice just plain work. Here is Thom speaking Truth. "If I could just stop being fake, turn around and be real, life would be amazing! If I could love someone truly, without selfishness, without worrying about this or that, but really show true love, well, it wouldn't just taste like it or look like it; no, it would be the real deal. But it's so hard. It's like the world's against that... but... if I could be who you wanted me to all the time, if I could actually be the me I know I could be... just imagine... just imagine..." My only question is, in the first verse, what is the "it" in the "get rid of itself"? I know that this song was written about Canary Wharf or whatever, but it has a more significant meaning to me. This song has some of the best lyrics I've ever heard, or at least they mean more to me than a large number of songs. my favorite part of the song is the end: "if i could be who you wanted if i could be who you wanted all the time all the time". The amount of energy people spend trying to achieve perfection is exhausting - it wears them out.  Also somewhat ironic that the products used specifically for the purpose of fitting in will last longer than the consumers.  The panic and desperation that we feel when we are not good enough will take us to extreme measures.  Perfection is one of the ugliest most painful contagious diseases in the world.  Everyone we see we will judge.  Why?  Most of those people we will never see again - we will always choose a value for people based on their appearance.  They are either better or worse than us.  Why?  All I want to do is turn and run, but I can't.  No one can run from reality.  The truth is, there is no one we have to be good enough for in the end.  If i could be who you wanted all the time still lingers in the corners of my mind, sometimes always on my mind.  In the end, gravity wins.  Always. listen up noobs, I'll tell you what this song is really about. Fake Plastic Trees is about a failing relationship. The subject of the song knows the relationship is doomed and has become fake. But he/she is too scared to let go, and is dragged down by the relationship (it wears her out, it wears me out). The lyrics are metaphors for failing love; when a relationship is only a plastic shell of what it used to be. I'm sorry I don't care what Thom says it's not about a shopping development So I was looking for a song on how I feel right now and came upon this? Not at all like what I searched..But to me it sounds like something to do with the girl getting plastic surgery? In my opinion this song says, that there's no complete or absolute happines for no one, it wears him out, it wears her out, it wears me out, no matter how bright your life is or could be, at some point you'll face nostalgia for old good times. At the end he gets deep in the sad feeling, of being with someone who doesn't give love in return , "if i could be who u wanted...all the time", with some frustation for it "but I can't help the feeling", looks like he can't get more from her no matter the effort. Great song, sad, can't stop getting goosebumps when I hear it. Esta cancion quiere significar la tragedia de lo banal, que en el fondo nada tiene sentido, y eso nos desgasta, creer y confiar en seres que nos hacen creer que nos quieren pero en el fondo solo nos usan (inconscientemente) para satisfacer su propio ego. Explica en la primera estrofa la falta de sentido de la vida misma, que todo es banal, en la siguiente estrofa se refiere a que mas alla de todo la gravedad siempre gana,pues debemos adaptarnos a las leyes de la naturaleza y no desafiar el orden natural, ACEPTARLO! y por ultimo habla de lo terrible que es sentirse confiando y traicionandose al mismo tiempo, querer hacer de cuenta que lo que es real es falso en realidad y al contrario, engaÃ±arse lentamente al querer algo que uno mismo se hace creer que es real y perfecto y es mentira, es tan imperfecto como uno mismo, ACEPTAR LA PROPIA NATURALEZA HUMANA DEGRADA Y NOS DESGASTA, luego valoriza el propio yo dejando en claro el deseo falso, la promesa de ser quien el otro desea que fueramos todo el tiempo, todo el tiempo, prometiendo algo imposible y eso desgasta, no se trata de una cancion de fracaso o angustia por amar a alguien que no nos corresponde, en absoluto, trata sobre ser sincero uno mismo con sus sentimientos, dando a entender que aun sabiendo todo lo imperfecto que somos por nuestra propia naturaleza no podemos evitarlo. la belleza de la cancion radica en la sinceridad de lo que realmente somos y en la ultima oracion lo confirma: si pudiera (porque es imposible, nunca seremos lo que los demas quieren que seamos, solo seremos lo que nosotros queremos ser...y ese egoismo lo consume, ser consciente de lo egoista que somos lo imperfecto que somos y no hay nada que hacer, solo resta fingir, hacer creer, que queremos a alguien cuando en realidad lo que queremos es a nosotros mismos, se averguenza de su propia naturaleza humana, corrompible, e imperfecta y siente inmensa pena en saber que no puede cambiarla, que tiene que aceptar su entidad tal como es y aun sentirse orgulloso de si mismo, darse cuenta de que se enorgullece de ser lo que es, lo consume, es algo que le produce asco y no puede aceptarlo, pero no esta a su alcance, no puede hacer nada, simplemente aceptarlo ) this song to me is just so representative of a relationship i was in where it was just so clear that we were both faking it, and all that i wanted was just to be what he wanted, and it's just so tough, and it really does wear you out. first off, GREAT song.  absolutely beautiful read a bunch of the comments already on here and i agree with a lot, but here is my take.... this song is about depression, and how when in this state of mind, everything appears fake, plastic, made of rubber there are three verses, with the perspective of three different people, but are all really encapsulated by the narrator, the person in the last verse.  the first verse is that of a woman, which sets the backdrop of a world view in which something as simple and as natural as a plant is in fact fake, rubber.  everything about it, the earth its in, the person it was bought from is false.  the whole town has rubber plans that will lead it nowhere, its own plans will get rid of itself.  this is the world view of the depressed.  everything is false, and plans to the contrary lead nowhere. in the second verse we have a man, the man who the woman lives with.  this verse is about the futility and falsity of the man work.  he is cracked, like a polystyrene cup that if broken and would easily crumble and burn up.  his work is to try to preserve beauty (in a false manner), but gravity always wins.  through all the verses, there is the repetition of "wears out".  the hallmark of depression, all of this - the world, one's work, its all just so tiring. the final verse is the most meaningful, as the music builds.  this is the perspective of the narrator (though in reality the first two are as well).  this is the main point of the song, that for the depressed mind, not even love can be trusted.  it feels real, tastes real, but there is that nagging feeling it is false, and will therefore not last.  previous comments discuss the idea of living up to some image, but it is actually simpler than that.  the narrator feels inadequate, he can't shake the feeling that his love is fake so he should just turn and run.  he feels he can't ever live up to who his love wants him to be, regardless of whether that's actually true or not.  he feels maybe he can for a little while, but certainly not all the time.  if he could just feel like he could live up to his own expectations of what he thinks she wants, maybe his love could be real.  but that is the signature of the depressed, its not what she may or may not really think, but his constant perception of not being able to live up to her expectations.  he will never feel he's lived up to what she wants, as the world seems fake to him, and he can never trust his own or anyone else's love. If you've ever read Paper Towns by John Green, this song shares the common theme. In Paper Towns, the main character's friend looks over the city of Orlando from a tall building and explains how the town is made entirely of paper, paper girls, paper boys, all with their paper problems. Replace paper with plastic, and both the song and the book imply the theme that everything is flimsy and fake, like the earth is made entirely out of paper. This song is absolutely brilliant. I think it's trying to say that the entire earth is made up of these fake plastic problems, except for the one girl he says is the "real thing". He inflicts self pity when saying that he doesn't deserve her and she is worth more than his fake plastic love. u r wrong about the girl mate, he is saying that she in fact is fake, she looks like the real thing she tastes like the real thing my fake plastic love... fake tits, ass or whatever a chick gets done, feels like the real thing, and tastes like the real thing... but he feels the urge to stop finding beauty in fake things and start finding beauty in real or natural things....women are born naturally beautiful, thats the 1 thing they dont realize, and most of us dont Toxic artificial enhancement plaguing society from asceticism to sports. The ethics of beauty varies from person to person. Natural merit, rude, honest, fair, blind to it...shallow or deep. Shallow seems to wear people out. Deep is far more honest. This song is absolutely beautiful. I believe it is about the struggles of a weak girl, a weak man, and then Thom, in a fragile state of being. The amount of emotion in this song is enormous. Thom collapsed on the floor after performing this in the studio, the lead singer of one of the most depressing bands of all time. When the song reaches the third verse and the instrumentals explode it sends chills down my entire body. No other song can do that. A song of towering emotion, you can feel the sadness of Thom. Fake Plastic Trees is probably my favorite song of all time. The world is fake.  Life is fake.  Love is fake.  The author sees the world in ways most do not.  He's more perceptive. The author sites two examples of people living a fake life.  Going through the motions.  And they realize it.  They can see it.  Yet they aren't willing to leave it.  They soldier on.  And it wears them out... The author then looks at his own life/love.  It looks real.  It tastes real.  Yet it's not real.  He knows deep down it's fake. He can't help feeling that he could escape his contrived life/love if he runs away and leaves it all behind.  Such an escape would represent a personal breakthrough.  A chance to be and feel real.  Yet he won't take that dramatic and liberating step.  He is resigned to live his fake life (likely for the sake of his fake love). And it wears him out... The author's sacrifice is summed up when he is resigned to being fake in an effort to bring his love happiness.  If he can manage to pull it off at least his fake love will believe everything is real and true.  It's uncertain if he can pull it off but he seems determined to try. Without doubt, singularly, the greatest song ever written and produced. I totally agree with what has been said regarding the meaning to the track by other people, however for me, this song has a very real deep personal meaning. I first heard it after a break-up. Kim and I had been together for 8 years. Married and lived with 2 kids from previous relationships that she had had. I left her one day and moved away overseas in a fit of total depression. I deserted her, the family, her family, my family and everyone I know. I was at one of the lowest points in my life. After arriving in Thailand, almost broke, both mentally and physically, all I wanted to do was be alone. I had had a dawning realisation that I had made one of the most tragic decisions of my life and tried to get her back but it was too late. I was devastated. Totally torn to pieces emotionally. It took months of therapy and counselling. I tried to get her back again and then finally she agreed to have me back. I raced back to be with her in London but she had set me up. She wasn't there, but her kids were her were now grown up and they ripped my heart out emotionally. It was a set up. I got back on my feet a few years later and moved on, but the track remains as poignant to me today as it did back then. It reminds me of who I was, what I did and how I will never get it back again. Wherever you are Kim in the world, I am not bitter. I deserve what I got. I wish you all the very best. Thom / Radiohead thank you for such an amazing track it remains with me daily. Luke This is my all-time favorite song!!!  I find it to be soooo beautiful, whimsical and deep. I think the meaning can be correctly interpreted  in many different ways. To me, it's about wanting some sort of stable "perfection" and doing everything to maintain it, even by means of  plastic surgery, "but gravity always wins." We all grow old and die. Love that seems like it can go on forever, often doesn't. Without flaws and imperfection, everything would be fake, shiny, boring and predictable - like plastic. To me, the song is about how absolute perfection doesn't exist - and that perhaps it's a good thing it does't, for we don't want to live in "a fake, plastic earth.." I've put a lot of thought into this.. This my thoughts on it. It's about drugs. Different kinds of drugs, as well as the people that use them and the hopes to what they'll get from using them (peace). Also the perspective of the drug itself.. First paragraph "Her" (heroin) fake plastic watering can(bong), The rest of that paragraph has too many variables, but read the rest and you'll understand where Im coming from. Second paragraph Is her buying the drug from a rubber man, which is the dealer in a town (Hollywood) of rubber (heroin) bands ( the musicians that use it). To get rid of itself. (they are all trying to escape their pain) "it" (the people he was just describing) wears her out. (they use it until its gone) "her" is used as a term for heroin. Third paragraph. "She" (heroin) lives with a broken man. Who crumbles and burns. (crumbles and burns the heroin) Moving on to the "she looks like the real thing" It looks like peace. It tastes like peace. "my fake plastic love" (the heroin that he is in love with.) "but I cant help the feeling" ( the need to use) "I could blow through the ceiling" (The struggle of using and not using) "if I just turn and run" (just stop and not use it) "If I could be who you wanted" (Im mixed on this. I think it has two meanings. His perspective to his fans, and the drugs perspective. (As if, the drug could be who they (the people that use it) wanted all the time.. Which is give them the peace that they wanted.. Ok after I thought about it again. It's not a bong it's a syringe he's talking about. Fake plastic watering can"... I think this song is about escaping through one means or another.(to get rid of itself) Whether its buying stuff like fake plastic tree, having plastic surgery (plastic girl), doing drugs(crumbles and burns), or through other people. Everyone has their way of trying to escape their suffering.  It's about us rubber people trying to escape our pain.. I think the video suggests that the people trying to escape through food (grocery store) The girl was perfect looking so that suggests to me ( plastic surgery)  The guy being the main focus of the video. He has this perfect woman, but it isn't enough, and she is pissed because he's doing drugs? Why drugs? He was flying above his bed and then fail to the bed. (gravity always wins) At the party he turns from his ol lady and goes down the stairs (down which tells me heroin) after some anonymous girl. Heroin is referred on the streets as "her" or "she", which is all through the lyrics of this song. This song speaks to me on so many levels I never can listen to it once.  Have you ever picked apart the movie phyco by Alfred Hitchcock? It's like this song..So many levels. Although this song sings to my soul, and I honestly am not made up to be able to comprehend why it does so explicitly well. Telling people what they want to hear is the oldest scam in the book. And life without those fake plastic trees is like walking through a desert of rationalism. a lot of the comments fail to allude to the overt materialism in the song. i think it's somewhat of a lamentation on a relationship that isnt meant to be but i feel more strongly toward the idea of a woman trying to create herself through accruing material things and such that she has become plastic. it's this consumption we're so familiar with. so many of us try to establish our identities on the things we buy. Relationships ebb and flow and can be challenging. You can't always be the person that your partner wants you to be. You can try really hard to control and manipulate everything (plastic and surgery), but gravity always wins. You can't control everything. I think this song is more than love, more than people, more than lifestyle. I think this is about humanity. "Fake Plastic Trees." Now I don't know if you ever had a fake plastic pant or tree, but they look pretty real, they sometimes even smell real. But you can still tell they aren't real. We try to build our world, and make things better. We can't accept our fate. Sometimes, that's a very good thing. But the point is is that it has become twisted. Everything has to be picture perfect, even if it isn't real. We create mirages to make everything seem fine when its all fake, a lie we created to feel better. But it crushes the author. He just wants to know whats real, (I can't help the feeling, I could break through the ceiling, if I just turn and run). We spend so much time and resources on a system we created to burn our self out in. What are we really doing to change the world around us? or are we changing a system we don't control. Thom starts with a picture perfect town, then a plastic perfect, yet fragile man, and then the most sacred thing of humanity: love. Even his love is fake. The song reminds me of Blade Runner. What is real? What is fake? The ever blurring line is wearing us out. I agree with everyone else's comments...This song is so desperate..."She looks like the real thing, she tastes like the real thing"  I love Radiohead for incorporating modern technology in their music creation (synth, crazy digital production effects) but at the same time they reject modern life and all its trappings. not too relevant, but they hadnt started using any studio effect-type things until ok computer i think where it says "she looks like the real thing/she tastes like the real thing" it's saying that if you look like you fit a part, you can deceive a lot of people into thinking you actually play the part.  this is the most amazing radiohead, it's so...i'm not sure...there's something about it that just has a magnetism and leaves a mark on everyone I appreciate the comment and thanks for sharing. This song is utterly and unbelieveably sad and depressing, yet i cant stop listening to it. The last verse, the last line alone should bring a tear to the eye of anyone with a soul. this song makes me cry. i don;t know why it just does. oh well. its a great song I'm really blown away by your interpretations. before I logged on here I was imagening his love being fake as the world. and him seing true beauty in her which he didn't feel like deserving. Someone being trapped in a fake place because she can't get out and it's killing her. She wants to do something exciting with her life but she can't because she's stuck where she is, and she's in despair. your comment on the meaning of this song... pretty much broke me down. that is exactly.. me :( interestingly enough...the band were in l.a when thom wrote the lyrics to this track... ...i wonder where he got his inspriation from...hehehe a blow up doll?? i doubt it...this song is way too serious to be about loving a blow up doll, he might be making reference to the fact that people have become LIKE a blow up doll but not specifically..it's by far their best song though, i couldn't stop listening to it the first time i heard it okay.. "My fake plastic love" how kickass is that? Alright, we all have fake plastic love, HE ADMITTED IT FIRST!!! I heart you Thom...I am fake too. We're all fake. FAKE PLASTIC TREES. Great song, i agree we are all fake one time or another sociery has kinda made us that way because we try to impress one another and sometimes in order to impress people we have to thrown on a fake personalilty, most of the time not realizing we're doing it, thats basically what i get out of this song i think Thom is analytically describing relationships under false circumstances, ending with the relationship he would currently be in. in the last verse he describes his "fake plastic love".  then adds "If i could be who you wanted all the time.." it seems to me he cannot meet her expectations, and in trying to meet them he has essentially sacrificed his sense of self.  enough is enough. hopefully, the sex was good, tho! This is one of the standard message of unhappiness to to false comforts. The line "but GRAVITY always wins and it wears him out." Is a great and clever description of it. Superb lyrics as always, and I agree that Thom does a great job with the lyrics here. Fake plastica... everywhere you look... yuppies in coffee shops talking overly loud to gain attention to their pathetic existences... 1st class passengers making the most of their limited so-called upper echelon time frame... pretty material goods surrounding the ugliness within... I see it every day. If I were Hitler, they would be the ones targeted for genocide. if i could be who you wanted all the time - feeling completely drained and desperately besotted with someone who doesnt care the same way about you. feeling like you're losing part of yourself in a futile effort to please them. thats what this song means to me. this song was written in 1987, when thom was on holiday in berlin. It shows how big cities can make you feel sad, and inadiquette.  Berlin was half destroyed in the war and has lots of modern plastics in it too. Wow I never new that.  Georgy must be a really big Radiohead fan to know stuff like that.  All hail Georgy.  If you know any more interesting facts like that email me them. Too Shezzie:  Interesting factamundos?!! Here we go: .Phil Selway (The bassist) records all his bits for the songs separately because he gets bad gas. . Tom Yhorke was once on blockbusters, teamed up with? none other than mister bonkers himself, Paul Martin! (It was never shown due to a dispute.) . Radiohead used to be called: "Up A Friday" I've loads more.       Jubbo ,Jubbo, mibba, Babes!!!! i seriously hope that was a joke georgy lol phil selway is the drummer of course uh i have a feelin the 2nd one probably didnt happen and radiohead was called ON a Friday because they practice on fridays practiced* I got the impression that the song is about him having an affair with a woman who is married to the "Cracked polystyreneman" and all the sneaking around "wears hims out" and her. So the relationship is fake as they can't  let anybody know about it and he wishes he could turn and run but he can't... Well thats my thoughts. I know this is a lyirc site, but this song is a musical masterpiece as well as a lyrical one. The structure of the song is quite simple, but it is the crescendo of the piece that makes it outstanding. It start so gently as Thom sings about the woman, and starts to build at "She looks like the real thing..." to its amazing climax right before the line "But I can't help the feeling...", expressing the songwriters melancholy frustration. The ending collapses back to the original tempo and tone, betraying the hopeless left in its wake. There are a few songs better than this in the world, but not many. i've heard many different meanings to this song which, in a sense, all are right and all are wrong... when analyzing poetry and symbolism, there is never a right or wrong answer... all in all, this is my favourite radiohead song and i can understand why Thom broke down in tears after recording this song, it makes me want to cry every time i hear it.... This is by far my favorite radiohead song, actually its one of my favorite songs period. Apparently, they did this song right after going to a jeff buckley show that night. This song is a masterpiece. "If i could be who you wanted all the time..." This is about FAKING everyting & how it leads to DEHUMANIZATION! A good theme for the new millennium!
