General CommentDoesn't it seem to apply to anyone who aches for someone they deem out of their league? All of the self deprecation and feelings of not being worthy are something to which most of us can relate. Isn't it funny how later we wonder what the hell we were thinking about the person?

Saving all the details, to me this is just about losing someone to time. One day everything is fine and you wouldn't change anything for the world. At some point down the road, though, everything changes. You realize you're at the bottom of a long downward slope. Things deteriorated over such a long period of time, that you suddenly look around and don't know where you are anymore. She doesn't see you anymore, she doesn't come around, and when you're not there she doesn't miss you like she did before. You find that you care so much more about them, than they do about you, that it's no longer just longing, or being out of your league, it just becomes sad to watch. You become a creep, a wierdo, to them, and you don't know how you got there, because for you, nothing changed. She didn't used to think you were a creep, and you haven't changed, and neither has the amount you care about her, but suddenly because she's changed, YOU'RE the creep. But there is no changing it, it's not a choice. But, you know, not me. I can't relate to this at all...ME68on May 13, 2012   Link5 RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@ME68 +3100%Flaghugmestupidon November 10, 2012  +1This is EXACTLY how I feel about it...

FlagQueenRadioheadon May 28, 2014Song MeaningThis song is about feelings of discontent with who you are as a person, and struggling to find your identity. The song chimes "I don't belong here" and "I'm a creep", which speak to the idea that the subject is having trouble dealing with the social environment they are in, making them feel like a creep. The story told about someone who is "So fucking special", and "just like an angel", isn't just a reference to feelings of unrequited love, and/or the pains of not always being able to have what you want. However, it is an allegory for how the subject sees everyone in the world as more special than himself, and sees that they all have places to fit into, which he cannot seem to find for himself. The subject wants to be like these people that he sees around him in society and as a result lists off his wants, ultimately realizing that basically he just wishes he had a place just as everyone around him seems to.thebirdieon July 17, 2011   Link2 RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@thebirdie +1@thebirdie I had to make an account just to say that this is exactly what I get from the song, because that is how I feel exactly.

Silly meFlagAllyMcNallyon January 11, 2018Song MeaningI think it's about someone who's in love, who's either just been rejected (unrequited love), or absolutely sure that the girl doesn't love her back (insecure maybe).It's a song about being desperately in love, whilst being absolutely sure the girl doesn't love you.The recurring sentences are: "I wish I was specialYou're so fucking special""But I'm a creepI'm a weirdoWhat the hell am I doing here?I don't belong here"(for the next interpretation I'll assume he's not been rejected, but just thinks he would be)In the first part it's about how he's sure that he'll be rejected because he's not special, or he wants to be special so she might love him, because why would a girl so fucking special want someone who isnt even the slightest special? In any case his 'specialness' is nothing compared to the girl, who is like an angel.Who the hell is he for even thinking he could even be with her? She's so fucking special and he's not. This is why he thinks he's just a creep and weirdo. It's portraying a feeling of self-loath, low self esteem. She could never love him; why the hell does he even try? What the hell is he doing here, he doesn't belong in this game of love with her. He wants to get rid of this feeling of love, since it's not gonna happen anyways.My opinion anyways. How I interpretated it. As for the verses:The first verse is mainly about how he fell in love, to show how much he loves the girl.A tribute to the girl, since whatever the case, even though he 'knows' he could never be with the girl, he loves her with all his heart.As for the third verse (I don't care if it hurts); he wants to have:Control over his mind, his heart, his feelings. So he could get over this agonizing insecurity, this feeling of hopelessness, or control so he could do better with her.A perfect body and soul in the hope that that could make her love him, he's insecure and loathes all of his imperfections, he just wants to be perfect.He wants the girl to notice when he's not around how much he loves her. Just to notice everything he feels, everything that is keeping him busy. As for the running part, I think he's picturing the girl rejecting him, getting scared by him or the situation, and running away from his confession of love.Either that, or the last 3 verses are about the rejection:He confesses his loveThe girl is shocked and can't answer, is scared, afraid, and runs away.He still loves her, still feels the same, but again, what is he doing here, loving this girl, confessing his love, playing this one-sided game of love.He doesn't belong there, he just wants to get away from it all.Thanks for reading, love the song. Don't hate me for it btw, but I prefer honey mustards cover. The running part was never my fave, and I love how he emphasises the third verse: "I want me one of those,Brand new perfect souls"<3Jin over and out.Jin91on May 13, 2010   Link4 RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@Jin91 0Thank you for your very interesting interpretation.Flaggedementson December 01, 2012  0Jen I think you are beautiful the way you think and believe, I would marry you in a heartbeatFlaggedvindicated.toeon March 20, 2014  0@Jin91 beautiful interpretation Flagjennylynn2on August 17, 2017  0@Jin91 Love your post!

I feel like a loser for admitting to being stumped over a girl for two years. Two years ago, when I was in 9th grade I met this girl, she was beautiful. An epitome of perfection, she was generous and had an amazing personality. But me, being a recluse when it comes to talking to women I like,sat idly by. We became friends later that year, but nothing heavy, we would just make small talk. It really damaged me, to see her socializing with hundreds of people, everyone knew her in school. When school let out that year, I knew she was the most selfless, prettiest girl I had ever seen...And here I am two years later. Were both going to be juniors this year and this summer, Not seeing her in so long, I feel broken. To make things worse, she is dating one of my best friends. And just recently, I realized I will never be able to muster up the courage to tell her how much I love her. And today when I listened to this song for the millionth time, I literally started crying. To feel so passionate about someone, who looks at you like an object, just one out of a million others. This song beautifully illustrates my frustration and melancholy. Radio Head is an amazing band.gurr57on July 24, 2012   Link3 RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@gurr57 +1I feel you, bro. Literally, the exact same thing happened to me.

It's dealing with unrequited affection, either through rejection or just not noticing they exist. Of course, everyone's going to take a dig at me, but I'm there with the song. Awkward teenage nerd, pretty, popular cheerleader, big crush not noticed, I think most of us have been there, done that, at some point in our lives.There's a lot of frustration - to the point of anger and depression - when she doesn't acknowledge or rejects him, but he's still attracted to her. All you have to do is read the verses of the song.First verse:He's so shy, he can't look at her when she's nearbyHe thinks he's beautiful, maybe even a dreamlike vision of herHe's watching her and her friends from afar because he realizes he's not in the same social caste as she isThe chorus shows his lack of self esteem. The second verse, it sounds like he's acting out with self mutilation and considering suicideThe third verse may be just before he commits suicide, maybe in front of her and she's trying to run away from him. He might have even stalked her once (the 'again' part of the verse). Like I said at the beginning, I really believe this is simply a very dark song about unrequited affection.fattywalton March 20, 2013   Link1 ReplyLog in to reply There was an error.@fattywalt 0you are so awesomely dead on,I made an account just so that i could show some love,I'm going through what this song is about.....so yea man!Flagwilcoleon November 10, 2013you are so awesomely dead on,I made an account just so that i could show some love,I'm going through what this song is about.....so yea man!Flagwilcoleon November 10, 2013General CommentThis song is about him being in a strip club.Listen to the song again with that in mind.You're welcome. =)alikhan84on February 02, 2009   Link1 ReplyLog in to reply There was an error.@alikhan84 0@alikhan84 Best answer on this thread.

Simple, but powerful.And I hope with seven months you've come to realize your fallacy of bastardizing songs just because it doesn't fit your desperation for something with "substance".FlagaSHYianon April 22, 2010General Commentthats why its my song......Enraged7on January 28, 2002   Link5 RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@Enraged7 0and mine....FlagxRineion February 20, 2009  0and mine too...FlagMirCoron August 08, 2010  0and yet mine indeed as well.... hurtsFlagAtrocityOfTheDivineon August 26, 2010  0Creeps!Flagfuturenyjet77on February 14, 2011  0I m a CREEP too :(FlagKIBon March 18, 2012and mine....FlagxRineion February 20, 2009and mine too...FlagMirCoron August 08, 2010and yet mine indeed as well.... hurtsFlagAtrocityOfTheDivineon August 26, 2010Creeps!Flagfuturenyjet77on February 14, 2011I m a CREEP too :(FlagKIBon March 18, 2012General CommentThis is a great song. It's a shame that they dont' play it live anymore. I think that everyone can identify to this song in one way or another. Best part really is the "She's running" part. Filled with lots of pain. I just love this song. I just love Radiohead.I heard somewhere that Thom wrote this as a joke. I heard somewhere that he wrote this about alcoholism.

He's so in love with her but does not have the guts to actually talk to her. Instead he imagines in his mind that she is some perfect being while he is just scum, or a creep, in comparison and is not deserving to even be there with her. He then imagines that if he would talk to her she would run away because he's not good enough for her to listen to him. By the way, the lyrics "She's running out again" is wrong, it's She's running out the door."slagman5on April 29, 2002   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@slagman5General CommentTo me this song is about a person who has serious confidence problems.  He is clearly in love, or rather infactuated, with a girl who he fears is too good for him. He displays these feelings by describing her as pefect, and angel and above all special; something that he feels he isn't.  He's afaid that if he ever did express these feelings towards her she would be discusted and run away from him.

It's a love song for all of us who have little or no self-esteem or self-confidence--those of us who hope the best for the ones we love because we have little hope for happiness ourselves.

I guess im not that disgusted..but it doesnt surprise me to see such blasphemy. Song meaning:This song refers to feelings. Superficiality and overlooked feelings. Almost everyday occurances in almost everyone's lives. Being lost in the shuffle. It's hard to look at each other in the "eye" and reference to "skin makes you cry" is an example how little it takes to set us off. How fragile life is. Its also an example of the superficial nature of women, and to be fair, humanity. Where does beuaty lie? It's whatever we see in others what we dont see in ourselves. He sees a person, most likely a girl, in a "beautiful world," and its no surprise that he wishes that he was "special." Where do you think love comes from? Its whatever piece of the puzzle we dont have. With that comes admiration and respect. The singer shows the ultimate respect. Allowing whoever to "whatever they want." Its a losing battle from the beginning. But that's not what is evident to the ultimate respect. Its looking without touch. People always smear perfection with their hands. He wants a "perfect body" cause he knows his own corruption which leads to his imperfect soul. Most of us do wake up and realize "what the hell" are we doing here. Not in reference to the big picture, but what the hell are we doing here in this exact moment? Why am I here feeling all this? "I dont care if it hurts/I want to have control." That's life. You're just like an angel that cries about skin, or you just dont care. In the end we all lose a sense of control, and ask what the hell are we doing here, and realize that we dont belong here.later.DarkApathyon September 26, 2002   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@DarkApathyGeneral Commentgreat song lyrics and tune is really goodcold00on September 26, 2002   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@cold00General CommentThis song speaks to me in a break up situation.

Because consumerism is faith of life with capitalism at full throtle, a predictable life of "No Surprises"; it only yeilds material and image "security".  Consumerism takes away anything that can be regarded as love.The lines: I don't care if it hurtsI want to have controlI want a perfect bodyI want a perfect soulI want you to noticeWhen I'm not aroundYou're so fuckin' specialI wish I was specialThis respresents how the values that mega-churches, American-Idol, and other products of consumerism influence it's citizens.  So, yes, he is singing about a girl or whatever, but the point is that he is hurting himself.. he admires and values things that are meaningless, and in return he gets no meaning.  So the song is meant to be a dark take of the emptiness that consumerism brings.  the key here is "I wanna have control", then "I want" three lines in a row, and finally "I wish I was special".Garv181on June 14, 2007   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@Garv181General CommentThis is another of those songs which I find quite interesting. After Rock Band 1, and playing it hundreds of times *shudders* I simply came to dislike it... all my other friends say they love it, despite the fact they've never heard such a depressing song, and I reply "I don't know what you're talking about, it's not that depressing to me." And it really isn't. All great theories, that it's about a boy, being rejected by a girl, because he feels he isn't good enough. But I think it's a little deeper and darker than that. One line in particular strikes me as odd, that nobody can seem able to explain, and they continually forget it. "I don't care if it hurts, I want to have control, I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul." As for the first two stanzas, I'll get to them in a second. The second two is what I want to focus on first off and foremost, because I think they're crucial to the darker side of the story."I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul." at face value, these two lines can be interpreted, "I wish I looked better, I'm not good enough for them." But what if that's not the meaning at all? What if it's an representation of the girl? Now we'll look at the first two stanzas."I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control." What could this mean in any other way? Except that, "I want to take you, even if you don't want me. I want to be in control of us." that seems like an indication of 'force' or 'aggression', 'violence' whatever you wish to call it. So, if we combine the two with our newly interpreted phrases, "I don't care if you don't want me, I want your perfect body, I want to be in control of it, you're so pure and innocent." etc etc etc, you get the gist -.- . now, I understand that SOMEONE is going to come and tell me off for making such an "outrageous claim" note this, I don't claim anything. I'm not accusing anyone or anything, I'm not saying it's implied rape or anything of the sort. I'm giving my three bits of an interpretation, and so far nobody has been able to explain it, which really just makes me wonder. Is it so far off to think that's what it might be about? It's a song, talking about a boy who's frustrated at the fact that the girl might reject him, and she's so beautiful, so pretty, so sexy. I get the image of them being on the streets, on a train, he's watching her from an alley. I can't quite picture the song taking place in a cafe, or a school, or a business office. Usually rapists are either angry at their victims gender, or the woman in general, or they want to be in control. To have that rush, or just to prove they're man enough to satisfy a woman. If he were completely frustrated with the idea of not being with her, does it seem so far fetched that a man might go after a woman, despite her willingness or not? And, if he's not upset with her, does it not seem like he would simply like to have her for a night, to prove that he could be something more, to have a perfect body, a perfect soul? If he's a creep, would he not want to taint that innocence, that purity? After all, misery loves company. Alot of songs are about a boy and a girl being in love, but one thing you must remember, these are adult bands. They are mature, and they're not singing about first crushes like Taylor Swift or Miley Cyrus, or whoever the bloody hell sings about that sort of thing. They've been in cities full of evil, I'm sure they've seen their share of it. zazielon June 02, 2010   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@zazielGeneral CommentUndoubtedly one of the greatest songs of all time.I'm sure I'm like the umpteenth person who's said this but this is probably the story of my life.

(you know who you are) you need to get some prozac and stop thinking your special.  I don't want to start a fight or anything, but seriously, the superficial undertones of this song, and how he wants to change himself are the best part.  Another similar song is "True Love Waits" the first line is "I'd sell my beliefs to have you be at peace" It's as though Thom doesn't give a damn about being deep when he's in love... he's just honest.  You can read debth into any song imaginable... hell you can give "Loser" by Beck a whole new level of debth if you thought hard enough, but Beck didn't want to be deep on that song, just as Radiohead may possibly have not wanted to be deep with this one.  They were merely trying to catch the publics eye with their first album.  It's a business.  You have to find the right package to sell in order to seep into the minds of the masses.  And you have to sell to the masses if you want to keep making music for a living.  I don't care what music you listen to... if they have made it, it is usually with this type of mindset.  Every businessman, and most artists don't mind stooping a bit at times.

Its a fucking brilliant song, but its practically the only song people wanted radiohead to play for about three years, hence the reason why they won't play it any more - damn shame. Legend has it that when radiohead we're first prectising the song johnny greenwood got pissed off with it, and strummed his electric guitar is frustration, thus producing the song we now call creep. As the the songs meaning well, apparently thom wrote it about a girl who he was infatuated with for a while.

I hold with the people who take it more as a personal song than a romantic one. I always related it to how I feel about my best friend, who I don't have any romantic feelings for or anything. She's just so beautiful and I feel like I'm just the background when I'm around her. Guys treat her better than they do me, girls want to be her. Once in a while I need a reality check--she may be pretty, but she's not a very good person.

It addresses an almost universal situation and common emotional reactions to it.  While I think a lot of people have hit on elements of what it is about, no one has really synthesized it into a clear analysis.  Here goes.First, it should be viewed as the story of a boy and a girl.  The female is allegedly "perfect", although we are not shown anything that is actually even good about her at all, aside from the fact that she/everybody/the other character thinks she is great.  We're not told if she has a perfect body, much less a perfect soul.  Nor that she even cares to have one.  Instead, she isn't allowed to be human at all.  If she is in, or was in a relationship with the other character, she would complain of being "smothered", not being allowed to be herself.Character two, presumably male, has some self-esteem issues, but worse control issues.  He basically pays her an unwanted visit, hence why she runs out.  He frightens her.  And, being the introspective sort, he realizes what this means about himself.  Not that he's a rapist, although he probably has some of the requisite feelings (described so eloquently as, "I'm a creep, I'm a wierdo" - the first time it is more her calling him that, the second it is his realization of it).But, then the music changes, and it changes because he changes his mind after the climax of the action (girl running away from the boy she will forever refer to him as a "creep").  He realizes her part in making him feel and act as he has.  And, he realizes that he is better man than that.  Who she is is decidely irrelavant, this has all been about him.  And he steps through this imperfect world that has made him a creep into a somewhat better one - since he doesn't belong there any longer (since he now understands what it is to be a creep on an emotional level and chooses not to be one).The song isn't about her, it's about him and his emotional reactions.So, the first "I'm a creep" is when he's considering stalking her, the second is when he does it, and the third is when he realizes the significance of what he has done, what he hasn't done, and the fact that he is going to be more mature, self-confident, and less a creep the next time.  She maybe perfect, but he's the one who isn't going to play her little game any longer.  She's still trapped in that same "beautiful world" where her feet don't touch the ground.  I see more "creeps" in her future.montresoron November 23, 2004   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@montresorGeneral Commentthis song is me.  ...everything about it.i mean yeah, i do have the self confidence problems (with good reason) and i can completely relate to this song.  having... such unbelievably strong feelings for a girl, living your life just to see her.  and yet, knowing that you have no chance.  i dont deserve to be within 20 miles of this girl, and yet id do anything for her.  like i heard on a movie somewhere, id walk through hell barefoot just so she wouldnt have to feel one ounce of pain.

It was also the first one *I* ever heard, so when I heard other songs by them, I was quite put off.According to greenplastic.com:The big hit single. When it was first released, Radio 1 found it too depressing, and so after been aired only twice it was taken off the station's playlist. The song has been analyzed by many people, and theories of what it's about range from Thom's terrifying childhood to Thom's deceasd wife. Thom, however, was not an abused child, and he's never had a wife. At certain shows, Thom offers a partial explanation of the song. Written while he was at Exeter, he says, it tells the tale of a drunken student who tries to get attention of a woman he's attracted to; in the end, he lacks the self-confidence to pull it off. The song has been released in a few versions: the original contains the word "fucking"; radio edit (on which the F-word is replaced by "very") appears on several compilations and is a bonus track on the American version of Pablo Honey.kaleidoscopeeyes8on February 16, 2005   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@kaleidoscopeeyes8General CommentI thought you may like to see thiskontraband.com/show/…its an animation and quite cool and to me, explains that the song (or any song) that is popular, touches something different inside us all and draws upon our own experiences and emotions. this animation is just one persons understanding of the song, and although does not echo my views, still remains quite powerfulcheersspeakon February 23, 2005   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@speakGeneral CommentThis is a great song... probably my favorite along with sail to the moon... as i was saying, i think this is a song about a school boy who is pretty muhc every school boy out there and is in love with a beautiful girl but he is such a loser and a wierdo that he thinks he is a creep and has no chance with her.But that's just my opinion.Seanzy333on March 02, 2005   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@Seanzy333General CommentI don't care if it hurts I want to have control I want a perfect body I want a perfect soul I want you to notice When I'm not around You're so fuckin' special I wish I was special i think everyone feels this way becasue we all want things that we cant haveblackliston March 06, 2005   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@blacklistGeneral Commenti think its about self harm and eating disordersro55rcbon March 07, 2005   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@ro55rcbGeneral CommentSAD... very SAD!

Thom wrote it, the band worked on it, didn't really like it, but played it for one of the execs anyways, and he loved it.  Then Radiohead decided they didn't like it and it wasn't going to be on the album.  It was about Thom's self-loathing which he decided was pathetic and stupid of him, (rightly so) and he didn't want to share that with the world.  During a recording session though, the exec brought his colleague in and asked them to just play it once, so he could hear it... They grudgingly played it, and the execs recorded it without their knowledge.  The part where Johnny strums his guitar right before the chorus was reportedly his attempt to sabotage it.  (of course, this is everyone's favourite part.)  The execs found a way to get the song on the album, and it went to number one.... Now, I have my own doubts about this story, like the fact that there are two versions of this on the album, and the fact that it would have had to be done in one take, which I believe Radiohead were capable of... but it's unlikely.  either way it's a great story.  what thom and co. have made clear is that they do not like the song, they wish they had never written it, and as respectful fans, we should not listen to it.  don't request it, don't download it, skip it when you listen to pablo honey. (which as an album they also aren't happy with, by the way.) If you are unconvinced of their hatred for this song, find the acoustic version (which Thom must have been fed a number of drinks and then pressured into making) where Thom seeths with restrained anger through the verse and then completely unleashes it in the "she's running again..." line, then collapses into defeat at the end.  it's a moment of personal suffering captured on a recording that's completely unmatched.  i've never heard anything so real.andruidson March 30, 2005   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@andruidsGeneral CommentIt's a shame that this is the song most people know Radiohead for.

A friend once told me that someone he knew  who was incredibly violent, once sat in a room full of people with tears running down his face when Creep was playing. The bloke had real low self esteem. Hes dead now from an overdose. I also  once strongly related to this song as someone who suffered with body dysmorphia  as a result of which, I imagined myself unbelievably ugly.  Although I was academically gifted, it seemed worthless when at university I watched all the beautiful confident people in their beautiful world and felt like I didn't belong there. When I recovered years later, I realised what a waste it had all been but I'm now proud to be an outsider in terms of my outlook on the world. Radiohead guitarist Johnny Greenwood  said it was a happy song about accepting who you were and If I ever hear it these days, that's how it now seems to me. My very attractive but conservative girlfriend has nasty names for her ex boyfriends. I asked her what I would be called. She said 'strange boy' or 'the weirdo.'  I said I like that and then started  singing ' but you're gonna notice when I'm not around. Because I am special, Im so fucking special...IM A CREEP, IM A WIERDO. WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING HERE.

The guy wants a popular girl but she is out of his league so to speak. She is the popular cheerleader type and "floats like a feather though a beautiful world." The world of the popular and privileged. He tries to fit in with her but he is an outsider and does not belong. He feels mixed emotions of jelousy and attraction. He wishes to be "perfect" and "special" but he is preceived as a loser, creep, and weirdo.

I had a friend who always mentioned that she loved this song.   She was an interesting character- talented, really beautiful, and generally a very nice polite girl.   But she was always under a lot of pressure and I only saw fractions of her sadness in the time that I knew her.   When I heard the song, my heart broke.   You can feel like a 'creep' no matter who you are and I know this song was her anthem and I just wish I could have known her better.  Truly powerful, beautifully simplistic lyrics.

In this society, there is definitely an obsession with perfection. You're just like an angelYour skin makes me cryYou float like a featherIn a beautiful worldAnd I wish I was specialYou're so fuckin' specialandI don't care if it hurtsI want to have controlI want a perfect bodyI want a perfect soulThese lines reveal the underlying preoccupation with perfection that drives the guy in this song to call himself a "creep." It is inadequacy that drives the guy in this song to feel the way he does. It's just depressing knowing that the guy feels worthless and feels like he has to be perfect just to be worthy of the subject of his infatuation. This theme is repeated in "Fake Plastic Trees." I, for one, have felt this way, as if I were some lowly cretin and this girl I knew were an angel and perfect in every way. The feeling wrenches your gut.ikemayusayon December 11, 2005   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@ikemayusayGeneral CommentHmm, not sure I like Radiohead much, but this song is good.

(don't bother reading this if you don't want to read a LONG song interpretation.)Not every lyric will fit this description perfectly.This song will mean different things to different people. Our experiences in life will make us think about different things when listening to this song.  For me...It reminds me of a girl I know. It's not the fact that she's a girl and everybody else has said it's about a girl, it's about who she is - this song is probably about a boy, but the boy described in the song reminds me of the girl I know.This boy is, by almost everybodies definition, a wierdo. Some might say, a creep. Has been many places that other people haven't. He does not have a perfect body, he has self mutilation, shattered veins from the drugs, and scars from times he can't even remember. His soul isn't perfect. He's seen things other people can't see, things in his mind. He has multiple personalities and the prozac doesn't help anymore. Hell, it never did.This boy sees a girl he likes. He thinks she's pretty, he loves the way she talks, she thinks, the way she handles matters and the way she looks at life. She stands out from the crowd as one of the most thoughtful and magical people he's ever seen. She is in a completely different world to him. She is, in his eyes, special.These two people, the boy who admires and is depressed without this girl. Is it love? He can't tell the difference between love, fear, hate and loathing any more. She is somehow introduced into his world but is scared away. She runs away. She's running out the door. She wouldn't be happy in his world.The end sums it up - he confirms everything he's been feeling. She couldn't stay because his world, and him, are too dark. Too fucked up. She wouldn't be happy in his world, and he regrets.By the way - the song I reviewed was the acoustic version. I much prefer it. Using the word "fuckin" in a song this beautiful is quite crude, in my eyes - in the acourstic version he says "very" instead of "fuckin".Deadmasteron December 22, 2005   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@DeadmasterGeneral Commenti don't think any other song can describe how i feel any better than this....it's pretty simple i thinkzaqcithjsuelvhwon December 26, 2005   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@zaqcithjsuelvhwGeneral Commentoh this fuckin good..especially the partWhatever makes you happyWhatever you wantthis song is denfinetely abt lovin some1 so badlybut u neo u  r not good enough for the personthe lead singer voice is so damm fuckin goodrockermybabyon December 30, 2005   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@rockermybabyGeneral Commentthis song means that zaqcithjsuelvhw doesn't know what he is talking about because that isn't how it is. she isn't any of those things and he is in no way unequal to her and if he really thinks he is, then that's  just dumb. you do belongimAubon January 01, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@imAubGeneral CommentRamthar likes guysRamtharlikesguyson January 07, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@RamtharlikesguysGeneral CommentI don't like this song much, It's uncomplicated, the lyrics are typical high school angst, the guitar work is unimaginative arpeggios and Thom's vocals aren't amazing in it.

To me its about insecurity and the way society raises people to think and act. People are told from the moment the're capable of listening that they have to ammount to something, that they have to strive for excelence, and that they have to be comparativly superior. Everyone admires beauty and intelligence and sex appeal, but no one can have all these things. Some people have none, which leaves them thinking that they did something wrong along the path of life that led them to their situation. They would give anything to become the people they look up to. They dont care if it hurts they would kill themselves, redefine who they are to be something admirable. This is commonly known as an inferiority complex. This song has nothing to do with suicide, and social disfunction, or love. It has to do with imperfection. It has to do with the average person and the feelings that get out of hand and spill over when the world turns its back on you. These are the feelings just bellow the surface, that boil over when someone is rejected, thrown away, or told they aren't as good as everyone else. In the song, the character feels out of place because he is being compared to everyone as though he is worse. He doesnt belong here, because he is so unlike everyon; so much worse. At least, he thinks so and has been convinced so. He doesnt blame the people around him, however, for making him feel this way. He takes the blame and can only wish to become someone special, just like the angels around him. He is the only person with his feet on the ground in a world of angels, he is the only one that gets his feet dirtied and hands muddied crawling on teh ground while everyone else floats by, glowing. He cries at the thought of perfection beacuse he knows it is something he can never have. He chokes at the thoughtconfrontation because he knows he is being judged and cannot cope with the silent ridicule. He screams at the thought of abandonment because it is all that he knows. He doesnt have fear of pain anymore, because he is made into an animal willing to give his life for "better people". He is striped of humanity by everyone around him and degraded into slavery and is convinced of his inferiority. He is born dead. This happens, everyday, to everyone do different degrees. This is a song about everyone, but not everyone are so well aquianted with these feelings as the singer. This is one of the saddest songs i have ever heard, because i can relate to what he is saying. I know what its like to be thrown away or rejected, and never be given a chance. I know exactly what its like to look up to everyone and wish that for just a second you could join them, and be ready to give everything u have to realize this dream. I know what its like to know that you are worse than everyone else, and have it reafirmed and proven again, and again, and again. This is the most beautifully written song i have ever heard.bobsomenobon March 19, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@bobsomenobGeneral Commenti've seen a lot of things people take this song to mean. i don't think any one person is wrong.

I may be wrong, but it just pisses me off that you can be nothing but nice to a person and they still reject you. Never have dirty thoughts. Never do anything to hurt them, and yet you'll still never be good enough. You just have to learn to take the pain and get over it.

And it made the song." wow, huh? i LOVE that crunching part, and it does make the song. incredible that it was an accident, it fits so perfectly in the 'creep' concept.the guy feels he is a creep in a perfect world, and while he talks about the girl the song is all mellow and calm, and when he starts singing "i'm a creep" - CRUNCH, CRUNCH...lol..describing the distorted image of a creep, dirty and lowly, reaching out for the perfect, angelic girl with his dirty hands...and she's disgusted and scared, "she's running out the door..."awesome song.vici0uson May 29, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@vici0usGeneral Commentmuse do this WAY bettermincepies686on May 29, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@mincepies686General CommentWell honestly dont you think its about suicide and how the girl he loves may be out of his league i mean there is a part that says,"I don't care if it hurtsI want to have controlI want a perfect bodyI want a perfect soulI want you to noticeWhen I'm not aroundYou're so fuckin' specialI wish I was special"Maybe he just wants to be noticed.My theory is that it has something to do with suicide and a girl.Blankohearthon May 31, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@BlankohearthGeneral Commentwhen i was little this was the first song i learned to play on the piano. i loved it.  i love the way i had to make my voice crescendo at the word door everytime.  i didn't understand any of it then, i just knew i could play it.  now i'm older, not by alot, but older.  and i can't even bring myself to listen to it anymore.  it reminds me of my two friends.  one is absolutely in love with the other, the other one is fighting the feelings he's forcing on her.  he's destroying his whole life to get to her and i'm up every night with him trying to fix it.  but i can't, only he can.  she is really what you'd call perfect, shes pretty and nice and talented.  but she's an idiot. and he's pushing everyone away.sorry for venting.ssslowlikehoneyon June 04, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@ssslowlikehoneyGeneral Commentthis song's about pure platonic love, no doubt....deliibrahimon June 04, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@deliibrahimGeneral CommentI like everyone's interpretation of the song. It can be widely applied to many situations. To me it's sorta different. I'm a high school senior (graduating this week) and there's this girl that I really REALLY liked for a long time, but I felt too shy/embarrassed to ever tell her. The thing was that we were complete strangers so I had no idea what to do. A couple of months ago I finally decided that I would talk to her cuz if I graduated high school w/o letting her know, I would never see her again and would probably regret it my entire life.I'm fortunate enough to have many friends and am a somewhat popular kid in school, and I almost have that "perfect body" (well, not perfect but enough to garner significant attention) as a result of my hard work ethic with athletics and always eating right. As a Christian, I always thank God for this. So I was extremely polite and courteous to her (usually I'm somewhat loud and might seem obnoxious). At first she seemed very shocked. I don't think she really thought I was a "creep" but more like a "weirdo". And I do have to say I am quite unorthodox (aka weird) in many ways. My friends all accept this as a part of me however.Eventually she came to see that I wasn't just trying to bang her and that I seriously did love her. She acknowledged that I was very "sweet" and her friend even told me that she thought it was "cute" how much I liked her. We even ended up being dates for the senior prom.Nevertheless, the closer I got to her the more pain I felt deep inside. Just as I can't explain why I love her, nothing I do can force her to reciprocate that emotion to me. It really hurts, but I'm not that "special" person to her. I know that I truly love her because I just want her to be happy no matter what. And if that means just being her friend, then that's how things must be.So in this case rather than me (or the guy in the song for that matter) loving the girl but being completely rejected, it's more about me not being that "special" person regardless of what I do and wishing that I was, because to me she's so "fucking special".justaniceguyon June 17, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@justaniceguyGeneral Commenti happen to know a few people who went to university in exeter with thom yorke, apparently this song is about a girl he was obsessed with there.simoonon June 18, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@simoonGeneral CommentSomebody above said something really stupid.

Sure it's simple, its not really mining new emotional ground but it's so beautiful in all it's simplicity everyone has felt the longing described in this song at one time or another, or the feelings of inadequacy not being good enough or not fitting in, its themes are universal and that is why its so easy to fall in love with *you're just like an angel, you're skin makes me cry*gee dosnt every girl wish a lyric like that could be written for her, who could reject thom after thatbritpopforeveron July 20, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@britpopforeverGeneral Commenttwo songs that prolong my feelings of sadness and love for her.this song here and something i can never haveslevletteon July 24, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@slevletteGeneral CommentWell, T-CAP75...

I don't think 'Creep' is about suicide at all. It's about a guy that has a self-esteem issue and is mourning the fact that he can't get a girl society calls beautiful, to like him.

Obsession, its what life is about. I don't know about you others but i myself have been obsessed with a guy, i thought he was perfect, beautiful, everything i wanted yet at the same time that he was too good for me. i would anaylize everything about him, i didn't want to admit it  but in a way i was almost stalkerish a "creep".  I tried changing things about myself to get him to notice me, but that failed and i realized how stiupid i was. i didn't belong with him.CaveatEmptoron August 14, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@CaveatEmptorGeneral Commentfist of all i love this song, especially when i'm sad. to me it has a couple different meanings, to me it feels like its about the guy i love, how he is just amazing and at times, when mess up i feel like i could never be deserving of his love, the chorus is like how at times i question my existence and how my differences make me feel like i don't belong, but probably the part that has the most meaning for me is the second verse, because it describes my relationship with my family and with myself, how i want to be able to control my own life and i don't care how much they hurt me or how much i hurt myself trying to gain that control, how sometimes i take it to far and go from trying to be healthy to not eating and running so far/hard it hurts,  how i wish they would notice when i'm not here and that sometimes i'm not okay and how it feels like my brother is so perfect and i could only hope to someday be half as amazing in their eyes as he is, but for now all i can do is try to make him happy because if he's not happy, they world just may fall apart. but yeah, that's just what this song makes me think about when i hear it, and it always makes me feel so comforted.barewireson August 16, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@barewiresGeneral CommentLanemik, this sounds more like old rock/punk than pop (Refer to page 4).

I remember that first moment I ever saw him at school walking down the hallway, thinking how beautiful he was and realising his locker was directly across from mine. After months of me just waiting for those 2 or 3 moments during the day when I would see him walk down the corridor to his locker, I mustered up the courage to ask a mutual friend of ours for his MSN addy.I added him and he didn't even ask who I was. The conversation flowed and in the summer holidays of 2004, we would stay up talking on MSN until around 3 in the mornng. On March the 25th 2005, we were both at the mutual friends party and we kissed for the first time. We spent the whole night bahind our friends bushes, just talking and kissing. We were both a little tipsy; me more so. He told me that he thought I was the coolest chick he knew, and that I wasn't a bimbo like the other girls in our grade and that I had awesome taste in music. I was drunk, and I opened my whole heart up to him, telling him I loved him and that he was a dream come true and all this embarassing stuff.The next day he told me that he had fun and that he had no regrets.He started ignoring me at school, and on MSN, and I witnessed him kissing another girl, which made me leave the party in tears (no one saw me crying except my best friend)Then, after 5 months of him not talking to me, on August 19th, we kissed again. He denied it the next day and hasn't spoken to me since. His friends all thought I was a stalker and I got paid out a fair bit at schoolI still long for him and think about him ever day.:( I'm a creep, and a weirdo.

Who was so beautiful it made you want to cry?  Perhaps you consider yourself outside of the social norm, and this person is as well.  Only they are different in a beautiful way and are happy with themselves and you...well, aren't (i'm talking about someone in particular) that's what this makes me think of.  everyone can be so bland and boring and shallow...and then i see somone who's different...and i'm so attracted to them.  i tend to idolize these people, wishing i was "special" like them..."But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here."  who can't relate?  feeling so alienated, shitty and disassociated with life.  i used to have a problem with self-injury, and this song offers a better explanation as to why than i could ever put into words."I don't care if it hurts I want to have control I want a perfect body I want a perfect soul I want you to notice When I'm not around You're so fuckin' special I wish I was special"like i said before i struggled with cutting and an eating disorder.  this is a song about hating yourself so much that you're willing to do anything to be "beautiful" (and i'm not talking physical) and pure.  Life can get so out of control sometimes...you can get desperate for any sort of attention.  you want people to love/want/need/admire you, you'd pay any price for it"But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here. She's running out the door, She's running out She's run run run running out..."not really sure there.  perhaps he's scared off this "special" girl.  i can relate there...someone you're trying to prove your worth to freaking out because you're trying a little too hard"Whatever makes you happy Whatever you want You're so fuckin' special I wish I was special..."i'm guessing he wants her to be happy no matter what, because she's so special and beautiful and all.  he's still envying her, and wishing he was unique and beautiful as well"But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here. I don't belong here."the ending makes me think he did himself in...he didn't belong in this and couldn't take the alienation and depression anymore and ended it.Well, thinking about this song makes my head spin, it just means so much to me.  I hope my thoughts came out coherently. i know i related the meaning to my own personal experiece.  but then again doesn't everyone?

The part of the song that struck me most and got me depressed the most was when I won. It felt so hallow because the night before I told her how much I loved her. And she called me a werido in front of all her friends. But Anyways I ran my best race finishing second place with a time of 15:19 for a 5k race. But when I looked down from the podium and saw her all I could think about was how much I didn't belong to be there. Even then I didn't care how much it hurt because I wanted control and for her to do something she didn't want. When I was running in the race though all I could see was her And all I could her was "She's running out, She's running out." It only gave the will to run faster. I wanted to show her I wasn't a creep or a werido.

Neither of these two give any of the credit that it deserves. For Radiohead to still be playing this song after 10 years is ridiculous considering the gamut of beautiful songs they have produced over the years, apart from the fact that they have a completely different identity now, which doesn't really fit the song.I think that the song overall is definitely about him loving and losing someone but it's more than that, as he almost regrets his own identity and life in blaming himself for losing the girl or feeling he cannot live up to what she deserves: "what the hell I’m I doing here? /I don't belong here." The song is centred on his dissatisfaction with his own identity and relates heavily to young adolescents, who would be loving and losing, while struggling to come to terms with who they are in this world. The song seems to epitomise the pain of accepting who you are, in comparison with a person you love.The first verse describes the girl as simply perfect, which as a bitter sweet feeling as she is beautiful, but this is the very thing that makes her unreachable, which is why she’s “just like an angel” but her “skin makes [you] cry.” He hates and loves the fact that she’s beautiful. Chorus and the second verse describe the pain of who he is – “a creep.” It is crucial to the song though that you understand that he sees himself only as creep in comparison with he wants to give her. He even feels that he not good enough for her so much so that he doesn’t belong in this world, this “beautiful world” (1st verse), as he says, “What the hell am I doing here? /I don’t belong here.” This suggests that the pain is so much that he would prefer to be in a worse world in order to not know of such beauty.bencorganon October 17, 2006   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@bencorganGeneral CommentThis has been my favorite song for four year.

It's a very simple song, with simple lyrics and literary devices, but it's just so real. The two similes in the first paragraph, for instance, really put you in the situation, because they're simple enough to be written by someone in high school.

I have always believed (and still do believe) that it is about a rape by a stalker.First he goes on about how perfect she is.  Obsessing on her looks and her movements.  All this mixed with feelings of self-hatred.In the refrain (which repeats at three different times during the song), he questions his actions, why he is about do the act.  "What the hell am I doing here?  I don't belong here." The implied rape or sexual assault takes place during the second verse. "I don't care if it hurts / I want to have control / I want a perfect body / I want a perfect soul / I want you to notice / When I'm not around"Then back to the refrain, where he again questions what he's doing.  Reality finally returns with her running out the door.  His world is crumbling as she escapes.  In the end, he's left questioning his obsession and what he has just done.To me, it's a terrifying glimpse into the mind of an obsession taken to a violent extreme.  Certainly there are levels of obsession, maybe the character isn't really going so far (although I think he is).  But I think he definitely goes off the deep end, the song portrays a breaking point of manic action in the midst of self-hatred and depression.My two cents.jcovarruon January 19, 2007   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@jcovarruGeneral CommentObviously about a complusive person who can't get their mind off this woman.

Plus if radiohead hate it themselves, it cant be that good can it?onvideotapeon February 03, 2007   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@onvideotapeGeneral CommentIt's fairly obvious to me that this song is about having an eating disorder."I want to have control" is wanting control over your eating habits. "I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul" as in, having the ideal body will give you an ideal personality and an ideal soul."You float like a feather" this means being light and slim enough to just lift up and float away.It's all about somebody incredibly self-conscious.pheministon February 06, 2007   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@pheministGeneral CommentIt's interesting to see how everyone can relate this song to a particular person or situation in their own life, it's so universal.Personally, it reminds me of one of my friends and his experiences with girls. Plus he is a major Radiohead fan. I remember him telling me that the only difference to girls between a good looking guy and an ugly guy is the word "creepy". A good looking guy can stare at you through your window and still not be creepy whereas an uglier guy can't even be friendly towards girls without being called a creep or creepy. Anyway, I'm rambling... but that's what it means to me.coolbluereasonon February 10, 2007   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@coolbluereasonGeneral CommentI feel the opposite end of this song.He is the creep.

"I don't care if it hurts" is his own hurt, self-pity, etc. "What the hell am I doing here?" bit, when someone is trying to fit in somewhere they don't belong to get close to this person e.g. the arty weirdo trying to hang with jocks to get close to this girl, etc.  As for she's running out the door, perhaps he finally gets the guts to approach her and she freaks because a.) she had no idea and b.) never even noticed him trying to get her attention and/or fit in... typical hs stuff.  Actually, I think it took a lot of courage for Thom to write a song like this, exposing a real pathetic experience of his life, and probably everyone has experienced something like this at some point in their life and would just like to forget about it.deletedaccounton February 27, 2007   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@deletedaccountGeneral Commenthe doesnt feel good enough...she perfect and hes...notim in that exact predicament right now...suxGypsyRoseon March 06, 2007   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@GypsyRoseGeneral CommentSaw them perform this at the V festival last year.

The girl personifies everything he is not. "Why can't I be special like you-why am I a weirdo?" It's an anguished cry as he realizes that he can never be like her.

I've been sitting on this site for hours a day to keep myself from drinking.  Music is such a saving grace.  I just can't wait to get into the real world again and meet wonderful people.  It also kind of reminds me of my mom.  There is something seriously wrong with her and it really fucked me up.  It hurts me so bad that she doesn't understand what is wrong with her.  She argues with her therapist and it makes me soooo sad.  Whenever I am around her I just feel like I am in high school again.  She badgers me about the same shit over and over and over again until I just completely snap and lose it.  Never once has she ever listened to reason.  She is incapable of using logic.  I wish she could see herself for who she truly is... a very ugly person.  She is never consistent and just takes everything out on me until I snap completely.  I wish she could just understand that life is supposed to be lived smooth and even.  That's why I love this song... it's just so delicate and gentle... It makes me feel at peace, like I can float away from my problems using the music.  I am so very excited to be going off to college soon... I have made so many mistakes but in the end just knowing that I am financially secure and away from my family makes all the difference.  It will be nice not having to lie about anything or worry about what my family will do next or try to pin on me.  Finally, people will be able to see me for who I really am and how normal and wonderful a person that is.

Anyways the song is about Thom and how he felt about himself and the woman that at one time he loved. The non-play at concerts is for the fact that the band really wasnt into that song and because there more than just creep they have 5 other albums that have tons of tracks that just as good if not better than Creep. If they wanted to be remembered as a one-hit wonder then they would have stoped years agoDonVistaon June 23, 2004   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@DonVistaGeneral Commentgrerat fuckin' song... period. i love the guitar and shit....lyrics are great tootjLPunkmaster69on December 30, 2004   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@tjLPunkmaster69General Commentyou're so fucking specialDarkApathyon January 03, 2005   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@DarkApathyGeneral CommentI don’t care what Thom Yorke says. If he’s too stupid to even realise the message behind a song that he wrote he shouldn’t be trying to look deep into songs meanings and should instead listen to his Britney Spears records.This song is him apologising to the nation for writing this song.“And I wish I was specialYou're so fuckin' special”This is him saying that he wish he was special and had talent.”But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.What the hell am I doing here?I don't belong here.”This is about the radio and mainstream media. He is saying he doesn’t belong on the radio, he’s just some weirdo who can’t sing. He doesn’t belong on the radio, his singing is that bad even the radio shouldn’t play it.“I don't care if it hurts”This is the only line where he declares he doesn’t care how bad this song is and wants to torture as many people as possible. He has since made a career of this, one the Shaggs could never hope to match. Other wise, this could possibly be about his castration, which he had so he could sound like he does.“I want to have controlI want a perfect bodyI want a perfect soul”Here he is again, asking God for talent. He wants control over the press so they will write him good reviews so people with no individuality will buy all their records because it makes them seem intelligent.“She's running out the door,She's running outShe's run run run running out...”This describes what people do when this song comes on the radio and at concerts and when he tries picking up girls at a bar.The stupid thing is, if he hadn’t have written this song, apologising for writing it, he wouldn’t have to apologise.Thom Yorke has said in many interviews that he hopes the world social order collapses and we are all reduced to savages living in the fields with no laws or religion to hold us down as we hunt for food and fun where only the fittest survive in a land of murder and chaos (OK Computer addresses this issue too.) That is what happens when you get picked on at Oxford University by the local group of snooty chavs. Apart from Creep, all their songs are about killing God for creating a ‘Creep’.FYI To defeat god, you need to buy a shotgun and fire it into heaven and hope you shoot her. So far I’ve only managed to give her a slight case of brain damage.Yournewgodon July 31, 2005   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@YournewgodGeneral CommentOVERRATEDFarhadon October 03, 2005   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@FarhadGeneral CommentI think it's about that he thinks how his girlfriend is something greater then him, because he loves her so much but on the other hand he does not feel good enough for her and so acts locked away and closed around her.

He realised how perfect she was and started to freak out, believing that he couldnt really keep her anyway. Then he eventually did lose her and this is his point of view now.

I had this adorable lanky Irish girl, with the greatest pair of legs I'd ever seen... Then for no reason started acting the ape.

In the end, he lacks the self-confidence to face her and feels he subconsciously is her.When asked about "Creep" in 1993, Yorke said, "I have a real problem being a man in the '90s... Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you're in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do... It comes back to the music we write, which is not effeminate, but it's not brutal in its arrogance. It is one of the things I'm always trying: To assert a sexual persona and on the other hand trying desperately to negate it."NeoSyncon July 21, 2008   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@NeoSyncGeneral Commentfirst, i love this song. every part of it.

I once met a girl who was just like an angel. In fact that's the very word I used to describe her.  Whenever I got near her I of course got very nervous and couldn't look in her eyes because I knew that if I did I wouldn't be able to look away. and her skin.. I'm white, she's black. She's perfect inside and out, I'm the farthest thing from it. Not being able to hold her hands and touch her gorgeous pink palms killed me inside. She has her life altogether and runs it beautifully. My life was a mess 'cause all I could focus on was her. It was like she had control of my life but didn't even know it. I was always pushing to get to know her better even though I knew I didn't deserve her. She liked to spend time with me and a relationship really began to develop. Through the whole thing I was confused because I didn't see how someone soo special could actually like me, but I just went along with it feeling like the luckiest guy on earth. I mean the time I spent with her were the happiest times of my life. She was my whole life. Then one night when all seemed well, she told me that she was just pretending to like me all the time to get back at another girl who liked me because she was mad at her. And that was it. She asked my forgiveness and I gave it. Then she said she didn't want to talk to or see me anymore because she really doesn't like me and it would just remind her of the bad thing she did. so I haven't talked to her since because despite everything I still value her happiness. then I felt like I didn't belong in the world at all. worst feeling I ever felt. surprised I made it through, but now I can just look back and know that I can get through almost anything, and although I might feel like I don't belong I can know there will be a light at the end of the tunnel.AustInsaneon August 30, 2008   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@AustInsaneGeneral Commentactually he does say "AGAIN" not "The DOOR"  I have an acoustic version of the song and everytime he sings it live he sings "AGAIN" not "The Door"  I don't know why so many sites claim that it says "The Door" when he clearly says "Again"p.s to me this song is about the same thing the song meant to Thom, an obsessiontheshaklon September 06, 2008   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@theshaklGeneral CommentActually, they stopped playing this song because it was so huge.

After I listened to it a few times, I decided that anorexia (or bulimia) had  to be a part of this song. I mean I can see how someone with the disorder could see another person as being better or feel inferior. This could be a guy looking at beautiful girls, or a girl looking at other people and wanting to change herself. The main part that resonates with me is "I don't care if it hurts. I wanna have control."I had a friend who had bulimia and she told me it was all about wanting control.tryhonestyon April 16, 2009   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@tryhonestyGeneral CommentThis song is about a guy who feels he is unworthy of the girl's love he sings about in the song"Your'e so very special I wish I was special"He thinks she's special and that he isn't and therfore he feels undeservig of her love.I think that a lot of people met sometime in their lifetime someone who they felt they weren't enough for them.pinkcherryon April 23, 2009   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@pinkcherryGeneral CommentI'm a complete sucker for covers:  Amanda Palmer doing this on ukelele is brilliantly geeky and awkward.

You cannot look her in the eye.  She is not real.  And you aren't   "special", or skinny enough.  You buy into the societal pressure to be skinny, so you're a creep; a weirdo.It hurts to starve, but the control, the perfect body and soul anorexia promises you is enough.

'i dont belong here', as in i shouldnt be pushing him. 'run.....' im letting it go, im not pushing him anymore cause i just care for what makes him happy 'whatever makes you happy, whatever you want'. but its hard! so freaken hard! 'your so special, i wish i was special', i freaken wish i was with him! im trying to let go... 'i dont belong here', i shouldnt be pushing him, but its so freaken hard cause i want to be with him!!! the last words of this is like trying to convince myself to let go and not push him towards this relationship he doesnt want!ooocazoooon November 30, 2009   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@ooocazoooGeneral CommentDisturbingsamc1213on November 30, 2009   Link1 ReplyLog in to reply There was an error.@samc1213 0you haven't listened to nearly enough music Flagspicyeli43on May 09, 2010you haven't listened to nearly enough music Flagspicyeli43on May 09, 2010Song MeaningI disagree with the people who say this song is about a guy in love with a girl and she finds him to be a creep.

He thinks she's so amazing that he doesn't feel he's worthy of her and all of his insecurities are highlighted and magnified.So when he says how special he is, he's saying by comparison, he's not special at all and feels like a creep and a weirdo.Just my thoughts.DonKillumination December 07, 2009   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@DonKilluminatiSong MeaningThis song can have many different interpretations.

I mean, we can't help who we have feelings for, right? However, if that person is some holier than thou jack ass then we are left feeling stupid for even having these feelings. Yet, even though we know how they respond, we continue to have feelins for them, as if there was nothing we could do about it. Eventually we would end up feeling like some kind of creep for even thinking about them in that way because they obviously will never feel the same way. I saw a video posted on youtube with Johnny Depp and some chick with this song. I think it was a perfect explanation for what this song means, but I think it was the girl in the video feeling these things for him, not vece versa. unicyangelon February 10, 2010   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@unicyangelMy InterpretationCreep, not creep-y.

I imagined it was a rocky relationship and he was taking a sarcastic tone saying "You're right, I'm not good enough...I'm a creep." I have a twisted view of love/relationships though. This song doesn't seem sad or depressing to me. It's more angry and desperate. Like "Screw it, I've had enough." I really enjoy it, it's got passion.monkeipegon August 02, 2008   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@monkeipegGeneral CommentI heard this song about a month ago, and I loved it since.I think it talks about two people who can't be together because they are so different from each other: the girl is popular/beautiful and the guy is a bit of a nerd, who thinks that she could never love him...Personally, I think that this song adresses to everybody who is in love with someone that think they can't be with.

Not a personal favorite of mine (this particular track) because it is so sad. Obviously about a person who doensn't think higly of himself (herself). He's found someone he feels is special yet he feels he doens't belong in her world. In his mind he doesn't measure up. Then he sees her leave, and due to his inner conflict he does nothing to stop her.

Yes, the speaker does feel inadequate in front of the person he is talking about, however, the words "What the hell I'm I doing here" cannot be interpreted as a sign of wanting to die. It should actually be seen as a sign of inadequacy and misplacement in a certain social sphere.Is the speaker infatuated with a popular/prep/athletic/extremely pretty/really smart...type of girl/boy? When he's just an average person? The speaker most likely has an inferiority complex, he exalts the girl/boy: "You're just like an angel, you skin makes me cry", when you look at someone at such proportions the only way you can look at yourself as inferior, which the speaker does feel since he earlier says "Couldn't look you in the eye...skin makes me cry". So for those that say that part of the song can be interpreted as the speaker wanted to die, (in my opinion) are way off the mark. By the way please don't give me crap by not specifically stating whether Yorke is talking about a girl or boy, both genders can relate to this song so there is no need to specify what sex he's talking about. =)Radiofanon October 24, 2011   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@RadiofanGeneral CommentThis relates to me, a girl as I see this as feeling insignificant in the world; you compare yourself to others and they seem perfect and 'so fucking special' but then you look at yourself and feel ike you're a creep and you don't belong.

You want me whoop yo ass?Flagrashelton2002on August 06, 2013My InterpretationA song about a hopeless love created entirely in a person's mind? I imagine this person being very withdrawn from life by choice but not entirely so. I also imagine (Couldn't look you in the eye) Hated and rejected by their community, the person finds solace in a person (that they later build up in their minds into the love of their life) that radiates a divine aura of sorts that warms their heart. However, the person is cold and does not return any of the boy/girl's feelings. Yet the feelings for the person that provides this solace and comfort continue up to some sort of breaking point. "I don't care if it hurts. I want to have control. I want a perfect body. I want a perfect soul." The person wants to be someone that the solace-giver will accept. However the possibility of losing the person makes him/her desire the power to keep them. "She's running out the door" The lover is leaving them and the person is being drowned once again into their self-isolation..depression sets in. There is a certain desperation and hope for returned I think in the lyrics despite the fact that the person knows the person will never return his/her feelings.Chaos6773on November 21, 2011   Link1 ReplyLog in to reply There was an error.@Chaos6773 0Your first line is a thing of beauty, isn't all love created entirely in a person's mind?

I think of a person usually a girl, since I listen to the Scarling version more lol no I am not a girl just like that version more and that one has more feeling. They are sitting in a class or cafeteria being insulted by someone who is popular and everyone around them all joining it and they are a total outcast. Time slows down with smiles and laughing at the creep/victim, people throwing things constantly, while they are staying totally still with a neutral face while they think to themselves basically about this song's lyrics. I experienced this everyday of my life until college since I don't talk much. This song just gives me such a strong mental image. I heard Radiohead made this as a joke and tried to screw up with it but it turned out even better when Scarling made a serious version.

"You" is the idealized, perfected self, while "I" is the real, imperfect self. In particular this song could be about an anorexic girl. "You" is the very special, angel-like  "I", that's floating in a beautiful world, like a dream. “Your” skin (appearance?)  makes “I” cry. The real "I" is disgusted by herself and is willing to do whatever "you" demands, even if it hurts, just to become like "you". "I" wants "You" to know when "I" is no longer around and has changed into "you", maybe so that "you" can finally be satisfied with herself. Unlike when "you" were here before.“I” doesn’t belong here (in her body?) and she’s questioning why the hell she still isn’t like “you”. She’s running out, as in having no more reserves, becoming exhausted,  becoming void.oukeon March 04, 2013   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@oukeGeneral CommentCommercialism, fear, change, whoring, temptation, vanity & gullablism — sport and a bloke called Dick.MisterBingon July 09, 2013   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@MisterBingMy InterpretationIn my opinion I think it's about the person not believing they're right in this world while with the person they love. "What the hell am I doing here?" Means one of two things; him not belonging with the person he loves, and also not belonging on this world. I think he's telling her she's so special because he's ending his life, what led me to believe this was in verse 4. He said he wanted her to notice that once he's ended his life "When I'm not around", he wants her to still remember how special she is.

He's a guy not necessarily unattractive, but his limited social skills stop him from getting to her, and he begins to admire her secretly. That becomes a platonic feeling, and once he doesn't really know her, he sees her as a special being, beautiful and unreachable as an angel. In his mind, she'll never notice him because there's something wrong with him. He craves for a perfect body, wants to be cool, but all he needs is some self-confidence.I see many have panned this song here, but I doubt they have never ever felt like that in certain moments of their lives.fredfranon November 30, 2013   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@fredfranMy Opinionfirstly, this song is brilliant. okay i start.this song is talking about suicide and how he feels invisible to this girl who is sees as perfect. he wants to be as perfect as her and feels that he is nothing more than a creep now. he says that she is special and he wishes he was too. some time in the song he starts to talk about how he doesnt care if it hurts. this is talking about suicide and an escape from the feeling of invisibility he has into what he hopes will make him perfect. he says many times that he doesnt know what he is doing here as if he wants to be somewhere else and that somewhere else is somewhere where he can have a perfect body and soul which is the afterlife.lanafanon December 16, 2013   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@lanafanGeneral CommentThis song tells how i feel right now :/chekalchanon January 01, 2014   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@chekalchanMy Interpretationpersonally, i think this song is about depression."i don't care if it hurts, i just want control."this i think is about cutting, the person wants some sort of control in their life, and they don't care that it hurts.when they talk about not being special and wishing they were like you, i think that's about unrequited love. they cut because they think that the other person never notices them, and are sick of not having control of everything. then you get to the chorus-"but i'm a creep. i'm a weirdo. what the hell am i doing here? i don't belong here."the person is thinking that they don't belong here, the person they love doesn't care, nobody cares, which leads me to believe he's depressed.the way that radiohead ends the song, with a faint "i don't belong here," makes me believe that the character ends up committing suicide because they believe that they don't belong anymore and the only way to end it is by ending their life.cheezyfriezon January 27, 2014   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@cheezyfriezGeneral CommentTo think that there is any other meaning other than the obvious is just ridicutard, I just coined that.

I'm a creep, what the he'll am I doing here. . They know they shouldn't be but the love is so strong. The perfect body and soul that he wants is hers and he doesn't care if it hurts.. just-a-blondeon May 27, 2014   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@just-a-blondeMy InterpretationI experienced what Thom may had. I almost let myself slip away. And then, this song came out and it hits me right into the feels. So this is my interpretation about the song.When you were here beforeCouldn't look you in the eyeYou're just like an angelYour skin makes me cryThis is when you have a crush, everybody knows this feeling. It's just hard to look her in the eyes, but you know and sure that she's as perfect as an angel.I wish i was specialYou're so fucking specialThis is the part where things starts to heats up. I always wanted to be what she wanted, to be special for her, to be at the same level.But i'm a creepI'm a weirdoWhat the hell am i doing here?I don't belong hereThis part is always spine-tingling, because of the emotion put into it. I always thought that i couldn't and won't be hers because i thought i am a weird creep in her eyes, and i don't want to be in love with her, because it's just impossible to have her.Johnny's angry riff and Thom's desperate voice are a representation of the feeling. You know, that mixed feelings of depression.I don't care if it hurtsI wanna have controlI want a perfect bodyI want a perfect soulThis is where i desperately tried to forget her, but failed. I didn't care if i got hurt, i only wanted to control myself, but i still want to have a perfect body and a perfect soul, just the things that she wanted from a man.I want you to notice, when i'm not aroundYou're so fucking specialI wish i was specialI wanted her to notice that i loved her so much, and in my eyes, she's so special, but i'm not, so i wished i was special.About running from the door, i (a representation of the door; or should i say opportunity, i am sometimes a delusional man) tried to chase her, but she keeps running away from me, and it looks like she's a bit creeped out.Oh yeah, Thom's voice also represents the desperation to get her.Whatever makes you happyWhatever you wantYou're so fucking specialI wish i was specialThis is the part where the tension started to loose. Desperated, i finally confessed my love to her and hit her, and yea, she's creeped out, then moments later, she rejected me. Hard.The ending's emotion is like the same chorus, but there's no angry feeling, it's all just desperation and depression corrupting your mind.But yea, thanks to the song itself, she finally realized my feeling to her after i performed the song at a gig. She was literally crying when she listened to the song and she told me that she regret rejecting me. Thanks Radiohead!hanif11230on June 01, 2014   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@hanif11230My InterpretationNot everything has to be about love! Thom Yorke was born paralyzed in one eye and had many surgeries by the time he was only 6! He had worn an eye patch that entire time. Those are the years you begin to develop and notice yourself, and see that you may be very different. Now that's just one way that I've interpreted it, the need and want that we all do to be perfect and to look like a certain person or sound like a certain person. Especially during teenaged years. In 1993 I was 15, and I felt as if this song described everything I was feeling. I have an older sister, who was 17 when I was 15. I was still awkward and pimple faced and frizzy hair, and she had everything that I wanted. She had gorgeous hair and eyes, knew how to do her make-up, had boys over all the time, and I felt as if boys resented me because I acted the way I did and dressed the way I did. I felt ugly, imperfect, and like a creep. This song is about desire and how it lurks in all of us. We all want more, we want what we can't have, and all that researching and stalking on these perfect humans and places makes us all creeps and weirdos. Desire people, desire.lillyadams11on September 22, 2014   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@lillyadams11My InterpretationIt's interesting to see how different situations lead to different interpretations. For me this song has always been my theme song because I always saw it as he was wanting to be someone (or somewhere) else and the person he likes is out of his leagueMichaelsCrueon January 03, 2015   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@MichaelsCrueMy InterpretationAbove all, this song is one about feeling completely inadequate to someone else, and by extension, the world; something we can all relate to. "When you were here before" implies that the person has left. Although this could just be regular, temporary leaving, I interpret it as the person leaving for good, which would explain the running later on in the song. It can thus be gathered that this person is probably one experiencing a heartbreak of some kind, which would also explain the idealizing of the person as a "perfect" angel. Even then, though, the narrator couldn't look them in the eye - perhaps infatuated from the start, and now the weight of their infatuation has turned on them and crushed their self-esteem.This idealization is also shown in the line "Your skin makes me cry." Why skin? Skin, being the largest and most vulnerable organ, is hard to keep flawless. It's also what's presented to the outside world. This person is seemingly perfect in ALL regards - there's not an external blemish to be found. Perhaps the narrator cries from the "skin's" loveliness, or from jealousy; perhaps both.This person is also untouched by the world - they float like a feather. They're not dragged down, and to them the world is "beautiful"; everything is perfect around this person and to this person. The world is their oyster. Of course, all this juxtaposes with the world of the narrator. This person, who is "so fucking special", is nothing like the narrator. I think that while "fuck" was mainly used for emphasis, it also shows the crudeness of the narrator - compared to this angelic being, we have a flawed human being, jealous and coarse.The narrator's lack of self-esteem is obvious. They're a "creep" and a "weirdo" - the world that accepts this "angel" doesn't accept the narrator. What the hell are they doing in this world? They don't belong. These lines capture the loneliness and self-loathing of not fitting in and feeling in adequate so well.Finally, "she's running out again" - she's leaving. This angel doesn't want to stay with the narrator, which probably explains the self-loathing, heartbreak, and bitterness. Overall, a very dark song, one that almost everyone can relate to.darkrisingon January 13, 2015   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@darkrisingGeneral CommentThe song describes exactly what many socially inept males go through when they attempt to hit the dating scene or look for love.  They have feelings of insecurity, unworthiness, entitlement, low self-esteem, anxiety/fear, etc.  Not being able to make good eye contact, check.  Putting beautiful women on a pedestal, check.  Coming off awkward when trying to reveal their intentions (usually sexual), check.  Being negative and not seeing the positive attributes that do make themselves special individuals, double check. Many of these guys don't have an internal locus of control and compare themselves to others.  They attribute their success in life to outside forces (fate), rather than taking responsibility for their own successes and failures.  They fantasize about how good other people have it and that if they only had money, or good looks or a better personality, they would be able to get what they want in life (namely sex with women or a romantic relationship).  You'd find these guys on social media looking at the highlight reels of other peoples lives, doing fun things, being happy and thinking that these people (usually old high school class mates and friends of friends of friends) have it so much better than them.When Thom says "I don't care if it hurts", I picture this is where the forever alone gets to the point where he is fed up with being lonely and decides to do something about his predicament.  Unfortunately, being a social and/or dating novice makes this guy a complete bundle of nerves, uncomfortably awkward, lusting over the possibilities, only looking for specific outcomes and coming off creepy, depressing, and unfun.  However, on the positive side, it takes this kind of awkwardness and getting out of the comfort zone to learn from these experiences BUT many guys lose hope after being rejected due to coming off like a creep, hence the chorus "But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here"  This also brings to mind the idea that these guys start on a self-help journey of sorts.  They go to the gym ("I want a perfect body") and try to read philosophy on dating, success, spirituality ("I want a perfect soul").  These things are all well and good, but it still comes from a place of not being good enough, that they are unworthy until they obtain X amount of money, Y amount of knowledge/skill/experiences, and can lift Z amount of weight on a barbell.  What ultimately makes a creep a creep is fear and their intentions.  If a guy is afraid to put himself out there, doesn't like himself so he hides away (becomes shady and pervy) and only has his mind set on the outcome of what he desires (in many ways objectifies women and love), then yes, it creates a persona of self-defeat and repulses everyone away.Ysmanon March 07, 2015   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@YsmanGeneral CommentI felt like this in a relationship.I self destructed and rejected myself.I find a strange comfort in this song.Gordy61on April 07, 2015   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@Gordy61General CommentI can relate to this song even though i'm an eight grade I've been a misfit all my life and never really fitted in any social groups when i found the right one i made a mistake of asking out too early, thus wierding her out to the point of being stuck in that "hi, bye oh hows your day then getting her to smile buts not  it feels like its not even a friendly smile more like a i feel sorry for that kid type of smile -_-TheFallenOneon May 11, 2015   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@TheFallenOneMy InterpretationSocial rejection in any way or form.

Dark, lonely, let me be song.  The song is very poetic the lyrics make me want to dance soft or hard to them and visualize myself floating like a feather in this beautiful world.  But Thom Yorke turns around and says that he is a creep and that he doesn't belong here. I think this song is about feeling worthless but still appreciating what life has to offer and through the darkness wishing people well and that he thinks his g/f is too good for him.darcangelon October 13, 2015   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@darcangelQuestionWhat if the other person's a creep, weirdo as well? jenniferagon December 17, 2015   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@jenniferagMy InterpretationI can relate to this song alot, and I'm going through a situation like this right now. I feel as if the part where it goes:"You're so fuckin specialI wish I were special"doesn't necessarily need to be about someone out of your league. Sure the music video hints at this, as Johnny Depp is someone that the girl just came into contact with, but the first line can be relate to how you feel about the person. The second line relates to how you want the person to feel about you, but they don't. They're special to you, but you're not special to them. The song hits hard.Adam18on January 03, 2016   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@Adam18My OpinionI agree with everyone's interpretation of the song. I just wanted to give mine. It's about differences between a couple, and the singer (boyfriend/husband) sarcastically visualizing the thoughts of his girlfriend, her thoughts about herself being "special" and the boyfriend being a "creep". It speaks volumes about a relationship gone bad.Audi1985on January 19, 2016   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@Audi1985General CommentToday I'm going to a funeral for my grandma, and this song is stuck in my head. For me it's about loving someone from a distance because they're such a great person. It's about realizing you aren't that great. About technically being somewhere where you feel like you don't belong just because you feel humbled by how insignificant and futile life is. It's about seeing the beauty in someone else, in their life, comparing your life to theirs, and finding yourself unworthy. Lost. But not alone.

We lost our identity in the Garden when we considered special to be life as usual.  Now if we see someone who has an aspect of what was then ordinary and is now special, we long for more from who we are.  Sadly everyone is broken in one way or many others, but we all long to be restored to what we were.  One man came to reveal a mystery, straight from God Himself. That mystery is that, Jesus came as a man to restore us to a relationship with Himself, which is the special He longs for, but not in our creepy way.  As we draw nearer to Him, we become more like Him and that emptiness gets filled.  This earth is passing away, as is obvious just by looking around.  We can have everlasting life, a life that takes us out of depravity and into fullness like we've never known.  I related to this song strongly when it came out, now it's  distant memory, that "creeps" it's ugly head up from time to time.Krionion August 25, 2016   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@KrioniGeneral CommentStore of my liferlixon September 07, 2016   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@rlixSong MeaningSometimes certain things just happen at  the same time. Carl Yung had a term for it. Syncronicity which holds that events are meaningful coincidences if they occur with no causal relationship, yet seem to be meaningfully related. My experience with this song is in that vein. I went through my whole life feeling just like the song describes. Somehow I never heard this song until recently right after I had been diagnosed as being Autistic. One of the characteristics of autism is the inability to look another in the eye and it was even one of the traits that helped diagnose me. And in a syncronistic way, as soon as I was diagnosed I heard the song and the first two lines grabbed me. I realized the song was a complete description of my life. I thought the song was written from the prospective of an autistic person. According to Thom Yorke it is about a drunk infatuated by a woman. Some of the statements he has made makes me think he is autistic and his saying the song is about a drunk is probably trying to hide his feelings about who or what he is. He later said he has a real problem being a man in the 90s and that is a telling clue. I have Asperger's Syndrome which is a mild form of autism also known as high functioning autism and in the DSM-5  it is now combined into the broader term Autism Spectrum Disorder. Knowing my own feelings and having studied autism in depth, I feel reasonably certain Yorke is autistic and the song is about himself.AutisticOneon September 18, 2016   Link1 ReplyLog in to reply There was an error.@AutisticOne 0@AutisticOne Bingo.

She was so beautiful and I was just the class nobody, a joke, and always picked last for groups or sports even though I was smart. But I loved Susie so much and she avoided me at school but talked to me on the phone but used me to make her parents think she was going to the movies with a nobody and wound up going off with one of the class somebodys and left me crying at this diner next to the theater. My heart was broken so badly and I wished so much to be a somebody but never was anybody until I joined the Marines and earned my right to be somebody after a year in Vietnam. Then I joined the Navy for Advanced Electronics and NAVAIDS after BUDS training then went on to Black Ops. I have designed and constructed several CATV, SMATV systems that are still operating 25 years later. But I still feel like a Nobody because of that 5th grade shunning even though I married a beautiful girl who died 14 years later from Diabetes complications and lost my son at 25 when he died in his sleep after his stint in the Navy because he looked up to me. I am totally alone now except for my baby girl (a Himalayan Female cat) but because of that elementary school episode, I still feel like that nobody. This song means so much to me because I can relate so closely to what it says.Rick Danielon February 10, 2018   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@Rick DanielGeneral Commenthahaha.... how abt a gal who got dumped by a guy she is obsessed with??? tigresson March 13, 2002   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@tigressGeneral Commentwhy dont they play thhis song live anymore???claires_advocateon March 27, 2002   Link1 ReplyLog in to reply There was an error.@claires_advocate 0because this song doesn't represent anything that radiohead stands for nowadays.FlagJackwhite618on April 28, 2012because this song doesn't represent anything that radiohead stands for nowadays.FlagJackwhite618on April 28, 2012General Commentbefore i read the lyrics i thought the guys said iam a widow lol :D:D:D:D:DD::):)):::X:X:XX::P:P:P:Pclaires_advocateon March 27, 2002   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@claires_advocateGeneral CommentSkitz24 you're an idiot.

I'd think that the best course of action (if I was this guy) would be to leave out the "creep" and "wierdo" parts, and replace the words with "man" and "hero".  And the part where he says "I don't belong here" should be replaced with "You don't belong here".  Then the song wouldn't be so bad.

I went through some of the comments dating back to 2001 and alot of the comments are by guys saying how its about them wanting someone they cant have. But I too feel out of place around certain chics. "You float like a feather" to me means shes so perfect in this conventional world we live in and I can fit in too that."I want a perfect body" to me means I want to be accepted like you are and I want to hang with you. (for guys/or gay woman) I want to feel like you do so I could be with you."I want a perfect soul" Wow. This is deep for me but I feel sometimes that society values this so called perfection we have created to make up for what we are lacking. Im not perfect. I cant smile all the time like some people do and ive got a sad past when people who are validated dont. I want to cleanse my body and my soul.Someone also says this could relate to Anorexia, and I think this rings true. With that eating disorder you become so obsessed with it that you will go as far as it takes to be in control and be the soal ruler of your own body.

Even though I have never "Fallin in love", I still have loved very much....people....friends...family. And sometimes these are people who would never give me the time of day....people who hurt me...and people I have hurt. A lot of times I have loved them to the point of obsession. I can't seem to help it. Now that I see no one outside of my small world in my room...I wonder what love will be like when I'm out in the world again. I worry. But listening to this song...is nice to be related to....and also, heartbreaking...to remember how stange I am. How much I don't fit in. How unlovable I can be. And then, I remember that I am a different person now...and I remember to love myself again. :)morikahjoon August 11, 2011   Link1 ReplyLog in to reply There was an error.@morikahjo 0Do you have a wooden hand?Flagrashelton2002on August 06, 2013Do you have a wooden hand?Flagrashelton2002on August 06, 2013General CommentLOVE this band, but hate hate hate hate hate this song. Perhaps it's because it's so good (and deep) but perhaps it's because some people actually feel this way. Nobody is a creep by birth/nature. Being a creep is a choice. People choose creepish actions/behaviors from time-to-time, but that don't make a man (or woman) a creep unless the individual decides those behaviors are ALL they are. It is the saddest song...so defeatest in nature.ILUVUon May 30, 2012   Link2 RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@ILUVU 0Stop kidding yourself. the song's not saying that he' being a creep, it's saying that people say he's a creep.

Regardless of who you are, everone's felt like this once in their life. Which is why it garnered so much attention, and which is why it frustrated Thom and the rest of the guys to no end. But it's not something to be ashamed of. Few artists have pegged down this kind of song. It's quite an accomplishment. However, Radiohead has plenty of other great stuff out there, some of which is equal to this song, some of which goes above and beyond it, and some of which that doesnt quite match up. It takes multiple songs to summarize life, not just one great one.KurdtCobainon June 29, 2009   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@KurdtCobainGeneral CommentAm I the only person who thinks this song means the exact opposite?

It was all light and fun and easy, until it was suddenly very, very emotional and intense. About that time, he started playing this song whenever I was around. He was in love with me. He told me. In the end, it didn't matter. In the end, no matter how perfect I was, how compatible we were or how often he told me these things...he couldn't be in a relationship. For whatever reason, he just couldn't do it. That's what I think this song is about. Self-sabotage. Fear. Insecurity. Control, despite pain, despite feeling, despite love, despite happiness...the absolute need for control over vulnerability of any kind. Succumbing to the rationale that it's better to push away than run the risk of the special person discovering you're not good enough after all.annieblizon November 15, 2009   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@annieblizMy Opinion  When I hear this song, the meaning varies alot, but mostly I hear the suffering of someone trying to become as beautiful by the person they are inspired from, or just wish to become. The extremes that the person will go through, even if it hurts alot. The person keeps chanting, " I wish I was special" but they know they don't want to continue through this road of suffering, so it's like them saying " what the hell am I doing in this mess" or " how did I end up here". I don't belong here.iveganon December 25, 2009   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@iveganGeneral CommentI have to say I'm surprised there's 600 posts on this song and less than 300 on every other song, including paranoid android and the like.I would've considered this to be one of Thom's simpler songs, a teenage love ballad, with little open-endedness (if that is actually a word) compared to the years to come.ThierryHenryyyon January 30, 2010   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@ThierryHenryyySong MeaningIn the book "The Radiohead Vision Creeps Onto Airwaves" it said the song was inspired by a girl that Thom Yorke had followed around who showed up unexpectedly during a show by the band.

I think it's a guys feelings after a break up with his girlfriend who was the one who ended it. Maybe she told him that she wasn't in love with him anymore, but she would like to stay friends. He feels that he isn't good enough for her, that there is something wrong with him that doesn't satisfy the girl. And she is so perfect to him. He wish he she felt the same way for him as he felt for her. She was everything to him, and he don't know how to get over this.  i think he also regret that he didn't spend the time they had, and now that time is gone.  odjeon July 15, 2010   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@odjeGeneral Commenti dont think there is a soul on earth that cant identify with every lyric of this song.deadraton August 08, 2010   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@deadratGeneral CommentThis song is so depressing, yet so many people can relate to it.

He knows the war isn't right and that Tony Blair was lying about the weapons of mass destruction. He feels like a "creep" just for being there."I don't care if it hurts / I want to have control" At the same time, the soldier knows he has to do his job and take control of the country even if it means getting injured."I wish I was special" The soldier wishes he was in charge so he could stop the war and go back home."She's running out again."

It has become an anthem for people who champion their flaws, fears, easy routines, and shit ass choices. Man up, people. If ya wanna stay a creep, than stay a creep and stop bellyaching about it. You are what you are. If ya wanna be more than who you already are, than grow some damn balls, set a goal, and don't stop until you reach it. And as for those posting about one night stands and temporary relationships, ya all are ill. There isn't a human being who choses to be an unpaid whore unless s/he is lonely or simply can't maintain a loving, long term relationship. All humans want love and friendship...and sex through that union. ALL. It's part of Maslow's hierarchy, and it's part of God's plan. And if you're going home with girls/women who will sleep with any tom, DICK, and HAIRY DICK, than that's not a feather in your cap. That's gross. They are gross. They don't respect themselves, their bodies, and their character to be better than that. Ooooouuuu, I cannot imagine having so little love for oneself that to jump into bed with just anyone. So fucking much for the feminist movement; all it did was reduce women to men when it comes to being visual pigs who will take whatever they can get from whoever will give it. Ick Ick Ick. So champion this song as a way not to have to better yourselves and keep fucking easy females. It's such a grand accomplisment.IllToast2Thaton February 23, 2013   Link3 RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@IllToast2That 0I'm currently seek a long-term LOVE partner...and then we're going to screw each other's brains out and not worry about when the relationship will end or if someone will get an STD or pregnant.

Throughout the song, Radiohead says that "I wish I was special." This is probably after a break-up, and whoever is telling the story is depressed. The line "She's Running Out The Door," is probably after a act out with the girlfriend.ReadyMadeFour6on February 06, 2014   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@ReadyMadeFour6My OpinionI think that part of being human is feeling like an outcast, but at the same time, feeling irrelevant. We have such a hard time understanding ourselves, how can other humans even begin to understand each other perfectly? How can we obtain perfection, and is it possible? We are all creeps, and some things are so beautiful, its impossible to feel worthy of them, but they enrich our lives nonetheless. These are the ideas that this song brings to my mind. I love the depth of it.Madiladaon February 08, 2014   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@MadiladaGeneral CommentAs a current teenager who often finds it hard to be as satisfactory as everybody else, I find these lyrics to speak to me like most songs fail to. It's not deep or insightful, but it is nice to have someone just say what's all on our minds rather than acting as if most of us don't have a problem. The meaning of the lyrics are of course pretty obvious, but still the bluntness of the concerns is what makes this such a great anthem. One of my favourite songs of the 90s.jpj46on March 18, 2014   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@jpj46My OpinionIn my opinion this song is describing how so many other people get attention and are popular, the person depicted in the song is longing for respect and attention, as well as other things of that sort. This person will do anything to be "special". It kind of reminds me of myself... This person wants to be one of the cool people, not the outcast, the creep. He feels like he doesn't fit in... And that everyone ignores him, he is frustrated, upset and I don't blame the person depicted...Nabison April 08, 2014   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@NabisMy InterpretationAt a first glance this seems a song about a break-up, unrequited love and the narrator having a serious self-confidence issue. But when looked at it closer, I have come to see it as the fictional song narrator revealing and showing his rather predator nature. A typical tactic with predator-minds is that they 'lovebomb' their target: you're my soulmate, you're special, you're the sweetest, kindest person. This is how the song starts: with a lovebomb about the 'angel'. The second paragrah continues with the lovebomb but also reveals the first hints that the narrator is envious of the 'loved' target. The narrator also hints that the target lives in a beautiful world to which he does not belong. Sociopaths know they are fundamentally different from the empathic majority of humanity. And they also know that if somebody else truly knew how the sociopath truly thinks and feels the other person would in fact label him a creep, because predators are in fact creeps. They do know how to mask it well enough so they can live in the world of empathic people. The third part actually relates sociopathic (or narcisstic) aims and thinking, and reveals how he treats his 'angel': control, perfection, getting attention and not caring about hurting her. You could say that in this part the creep takes his mask off and reveals his true nature to the 'angel'. As a consequence she runs away from him, as she should. As is furthermore typical, after she runs because she realized what a creep he really is, he tries to win her again with a renewed lovebomb and promising he'll do whatever she wants (empty promises).So, this song is about a sociopath, his methods in winning someone but also hurting them until they runsweetsunrayon May 13, 2014   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@sweetsunrayGeneral CommentThis is about someone who is fake.

It's about how a band member followed some beautiful girl that didn't even know he existed and he couldn't muster up the courage to ever talk to her. Then ironically, she fatefully attended one of their concerts later  on and she never knew the song was about her. He felt like a creep because she was so perfect, and didn't think he was good enough to talk to her. So while it is sad, it's not as horribly dark as some of us have thought. It might be deep, but it's not like, about a weirdo who stalks women all the time.virgodefinedon December 10, 2014   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@virgodefinedGeneral CommentThe darkness of the emotions can be recognised clearly from the very first verse.There's a man who's rather mesmerised by the sight of this girl. In his eys she's perfect, the poster image for the word beauty. Her movement is graceful, and elegant. She lives in her own world of perfection - a world he can never, and will never be a part of.But he's in love with her.Yet he can never approach her. He's not worth that much. He places himself on a level way beneath that of this 'angel', who makes him want to cry every time his gaze wonders over her skin. His self-conciousness, has evoked feelings of helplessness, and he cannot bring himself to see any ounce of value within him.He's a creep.He wants to be perfect, so that he can be with her. So she can feel what he does about her.But he knows that's just a fantasy.So he thinks that it would be better in he just...disappeared.Maybe, just maybe she'll notice him then. Or maybe he's just tired of the agony caused by this unrequited love.-------------Great song. Seriously, utterly AMAZING lyrics. But I mean, come on it's Radiohead for crying out loud. Even though this heartfelt song is a little dark. There's a clear message, most people can relate to. We all feel sef-concious sometimes.AnoMosaicon January 16, 2015   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@AnoMosaicMy InterpretationThe first time I heard this song I thought it was about a man who's fond of a woman he sees as "an angel", that he sees kinda perfect. She's so beautiful, and he loves her so much, she's "so fucking special". But he feels a creep, a weirdo, not the one everybody would like to see with her. He's not the prince charming or something like that and he feels uncomfortable in her world. He wishes he was special, he was maybe more handsome or richer, but he just feels creep, weird.That's the way I see the song.(sorry for any mistakes, I'm italian!)maybepunkyon March 01, 2015   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@maybepunkyMy InterpretationI guess I'm the only one who see this song as a rapist point of view.  Concentrate on the lyrics. Having control.  Don't care if it hurts.    The perfect body and soul he wants is hers. Not his ownThe constant fear of him being around in noticing when he's not there.  And as she runs to get away from him.   But, yeah, I'm a weirdo.  lol.  Kinda sick interpretation but can easy go that way.thomas1373on March 07, 2015   LinkNo RepliesLog in to reply There was an error.@thomas1373My InterpretationPerhaps it's because I'm currently doing a project on mental illnesses but I believe this song could be what someone with a mental illness, like depression, could be feeling. "I don't care if it hurts, i want to have control" could represent harming one's self, considering self harm is usually the outcome of a person lacking control in their lives. And anorexia can be caused by a lack of control, leading the person to become obsessed with their weight, image, etc. "I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul" People who suffer from Anorexia or Bulimia usually strive for this "perfect" image. Not only that but, many depressed people loathe themselves meaning they probably want to be "perfect" as well. Other parts of the song, like the lyric "she's running out again" could represent losing someone important or having them walk (or in this case, run haha) out of your life and being accustomed to people leaving. As for the beginning of the song, "When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye. You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry. You float like a feather, in a beautiful world. And I wish I was special.You're so fuckin' special" seems to be about loving and idolizing someone and not wanting to hurt them. The part saying "I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here" again, reminds me of someone with a mental illness, feeling out of place and feeling as if they don't belong in the world.ultimatecaton May 04, 2015   Link1 ReplyLog in to reply There was an error.@ultimatecat 0@ultimatecat  not trying to be mean but dude you can shove that psychological shit up your ass dude this about MUSIC not science ok?

I wasn't necessarily called a creep or a weirdo but the pain you feel when someone you feel so passionate about sits. I front of you talking about their girl and how amazing she is hurts like hell.

This is dark, but I think this song is about a rapist/killer.Think, he uses the word angel and how he can't look at this angel. Maybe because he is guilty? Her skin makes him cry because it is dead and he has violated it. She floats like a feather in the beautiful world (heaven) and he desires his victim and thinks she's "so fucking special" and now he's done what he has done he feels insecure and disgusted with himself. Leading him to think he doesn't belong here. This next bit might scare you when you analyse the lyrics like I have. This is why I'm convinced as to the song being about a rapist:"I don't care if it hurts I wanna have control"Rapists don't consider pain. He wants to have control, he doesn't care about consent. He wants power. What else could he mean by "I don't care if it hurts"? And it leading to him wanting control? In the bridge he quotes "run". But the way he sings this is so haunting. He sings it out of breath and like he is running himself. He sings of her running out and running away. Away from him maybe? At the end he is calm and says "whatever makes you happy" suggesting he can't control his lust and frustration as to wanting to have sex with her. So he is desperate for her forgiveness.Honestly, Tohm has some very very dark lyrics. This song actually scares me after analysing the lyrics. So beautiful though.
